possible alternative is the use of bioethanol, produced by renewable resources such assugarcane   bagasse.   Two   thirds   of   the   cultivated   sugarcane   biomass   are   sugarcanebagasse and leaves, not fermentable when the current, first-generation (1G) process isused. A great interest has been given to techniques capable of utilizing the carbohydratesfrom   this   material.  Among   them,   production   of   second   generation   (2G)   ethanol   is   apossible alternative. 2G ethanol requires two additional operations: a pretreatment and ahydrolysis   stage.   Regarding   the   hydrolysis,   the   dominant   technical   solution   has   beenbased on the use of enzymatic complexes to hydrolyze the lignocellulosic substrate. To
ensure   the   feasibility   of   the   process,   a   high   final   concentration   of   glucose   after   theenzymatic hydrolysis is desirable. To achieve this objective, a high solid consistency in thereactor is necessary. However, a high load of solids generates a series of operationaldifficulties within the reactor. This is a crucial bottleneck of the 2G process. A possiblesolution is using a fed-batch process, with feeding profiles of enzymes and substrate thatenhance   the   process   yield   and   productivity.   The   main   objective   of   this   work   was   toimplement and test a system to infer online concentrations of fermentable carbohydrates inthe reactive system,  and to optimize the feeding strategy of substrate and/or enzymaticcomplex, according to a model-based control strategy. Batch and fed-batch experimentswere conducted in order to test the adherence of four simplified kinetic models. The modelwith best adherence to the experimental data (a modified Michaelis-Menten model withinhibition   by   the   product)   was   used   to   train   an  Artificial   Neural   Network   (ANN)   as   asoftsensor to predict glucose concentrations. Further, this ANN may be used in a closed-loop control strategy. A feeding profile optimizer was implemented, based on the optimalcontrol approach. The ANN was capable of inferring the product concentration from theavailable data with good adherence (Determination Coefficient of 0.972). The optimizationalgorithm generated profiles that increased a process performance index while maintainingoperational   levels   within   the   reactor,   reaching   glucose   concentrations   close   to   thoseutilized in current first generation technology a (ranging between 156.0 g.L ¹ and 168.3
g.L ¹).   However   rough   estimates   for   scaling   up   the   reactor   to   industrial   dimensionsindicate that this conventional reactor design must be replaced by a two-stage reactor, tominimize the volume of liquid to be stirred.

⁻⁻vRESUMOA crescente demanda por combustíveis líquidos, bem como a diminuição das reservas depetróleo, inevitáveis a longo prazo, induzem pesquisas por novas fontes de energia. Umapossível solução é o uso do bioetanol, produzido de resíduos, como o bagaço de cana-de-açúcar. Dois terços da biomassa cultivada são bagaço e folhas. Estas frações não sãofermentescíveis quando se usa a tecnologia de primeira geração atual (1G). Técnicascapazes de utilizar os carboidratos deste material vem sendo estudas, a fim de aumentara   rentabilidade   da   cadeia   produtiva.   Dentre   elas,   a   produção   de   etanol   de   segundageração (2G) é uma possível alternativa.  Etanol 2G requer duas operações adicionais:etapas de pré-tratamento e hidrólise. Considerando a hidrólise, a técnica dominante temsido a utilização de complexos enzimáticos para hidrolisar o substrato lignocelulósico.
Para   assegurar   a   viabilidade   do   processo,   uma   alta   concentração   final   de   glicose   énecessária ao final do processo.  Para atingir esse objetivo, uma alta concentração desólidos no reator é necessária. No entanto, uma carga grande de sólidos gera uma sériede dificuldades operacionais para o processo. Este é um gargalo crucial do processo 2G.
Uma   possível   solução   é   utilizar   um   processo   de   batelada   alimentada,   com   perfis   dealimentação de enzima e substrato para aumentar produtividade e rendimento. O principalobjetivo deste trabalho é implementar e testar um sistema para inferir concentração decarboidratos   fermentescíveis   automaticamente   e   otimizar   a   política   de   substrato   e/ouenzima em tempo real, de acordo com uma estratégia de controle baseada em modelocinético. Experimentos de batelada e batelada alimentada foram realizados a fim de testara aderência de 4 modelos cinéticos simplificados. O modelo com melhor aderência aosdados   experimentais   (um   modelo   de   Michaelis-Menten   modificado   com   inibição   porproduto) foi utilizado para gerar dados a fim de treinar uma rede neural artificial parapredizer concentrações de glicose automaticamente. Em estudos futuros, esta rede podeser utilizada para compor o fechamento da malha de controle. Um otimizador de perfil dealimentação foi implementado, baseado em uma abordagem de controle ótimo. A redeneural foi capaz de predizer a concentração de produto com os dados disponíveis demaneira satisfatória (Coeficiente de Determinação de 0.972).  O algoritmo de otimizaçãogerou   perfis   que   aumentaram   o   desempenho   do   processo   enquanto   manteve   ascondições da hidrólise dentro de níveis operacionais, e gerou concentrações de glicosepróximas as obtidas pelo caldo de cana-de-açúcar da primeira geração (valores entre156.0 g.L ¹ e 168.3 g.L ¹). No entanto, estimativas iniciais de aumento de escala doprocesso   demonstraram   que   para   atingir   dimensões   industriais   o   projeto   do   reatorutilizado deve ser analisado, substituindo o mesmo por um processo em dois estágiospara diminuir o volume do reator e energia para agitação.

xiii1. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVESThe  continuous  demand  growth  for  liquid  fuels,   alongside  with  the  decrease  offossil oil reserves, unavoidable in the long term, induces investigations for new energysources. A possible solution to substitute some liquid fossil fuels is the use of bioethanol,produced from renewable sources (NAIK et al., 2010).
In Brazil, a massive production of ethanol as automotive fuel occurred in the 1970s,when the government initiated a national program (Pró-Álcool) to reduce the dependencyon foreign refined oil. The Pró-Álcool program had as main starting material sugarcanejuice. This culture was intensified during this period, especially in southeast Brazil. Thetechnology used in the program, called first generation (1G), was similar to the one utilizednowadays.   But   two   thirds   of   the   cultivated   biomass,   i.e.   sugarcane   bagasse   or   otherlignocellulosic materials such as leaves, generates non fermentable substrates when thecurrent process is applied (FREITAS & KANEKO, 2012).
Even though the biomass is non fermentable via 1G processes may be used togenerate other forms of energy (bioelectricity, production of syngas and so on), there isgreat interest in developing techniques capable of converting the carbohydrates from thismaterial into bioethanol, thus generating more ethanol from each sugarcane mass unit(DANTAS et al., 2013).
Currently, large-scale 2G ethanol production still presents economic bottlenecks.
Among the most important technical hindrances is the scale up of the hydrolysis processto industrial application, in order to generate high product yields while keeping costs low(MODENBACH & NOKES, 2013).
This work intended to test and implement a softsensor architecture using ArtificialNeural   Networks,   to   predict   the   concentration   of   sugars   in   a   bioreactor   during   theenzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated sugarcane bagasse using cellulases from a commercialcocktail.   Besides,   an   algorithm   based   on   optimal   control   theory   was   implemented,   todefine feeding strategies of substrate and/or enzymatic complex for the hydrolysis reactor.
It should be stressed that the main goal of this work is not to propose an optimaloperational policy for a specific bioreactor, but rather to establish a consistent methodologyto be applied in industrial plants. Besides, the experimental data that were used to fitmodels and to tune softsensors, and although the methodology may be consistent, the1final results hardly could be applied, directly, to industry-scale reactors. 
Nevertheless, the algorithms to be described here, using computational intelligencetools and applying advanced dynamic control theory, are expected, with modifications, tobe useful for further use in the biorefinery, thus contributing for the consolidation of the 2Gindustrial process.
22. LITERATURE REVIEW2.1. LIGNOCELLULOSIC COMPOUNDSSecond   generation   biofuels   are   fuels   produced   from   lignocellulosic   substrates.
These   are   fibers   found   in   plants   and   vegetables.   Their   main   function   is   to   providestructural support, while assuring microbiological and chemical protection. The fractions oflignocellulosic materials are mostly composed by cellulose (32–55%), hemicellulose (19–24%), lignin (23–32%) and ashes (3–6%) (SANTOS et al., 2012). 
Cellulose, (C6H1005)n,  is the most abundant polysaccharide in the fiber. Its orderedstructure consists of several hundred glucose molecules (XU et al., 2013). The cellulosespatial conformation is determined by three main interactions. The first interaction is theglycosidic   bond   that   unites   a   glucose   to   another   glucose   molecule   through   acovalent bond. This generates cellobiose, and this disaccharide is repeated throughout thepolymer   chain   (ROCHA   et   al.,   2011).   The   second   interaction   is   among   hydrogenmolecules from the same chain and the third between adjacent chains. Due to theseinteractions, part of cellulose macromolecules can form a crystalline region, granting to theentire structure a high cohesiveness, and rendering it insoluble in water and several othersolvents, and resistant to hydrolysis (SANTOS et al., 2012).
Hemicellulose   differs   significantly   from   cellulose.   It   is   a   heteropolysaccharidecomposed by hexoses (glucose, galactose and mannose), pentoses (xylose, the mostabundant   monomer,   and   arabinose),   acetic   acid,   glucuronic   acid   and   4-O-methy-glucuronic   acid.   The   relation   between   these   substances   differs   from   vegetable   tovegetable. This portion of the  tissue does not  form  crystalline regions, thus  it can  beremoved or hydrolyzed more easily than cellulose (CANILHA et al., 2012).
Lignin is formed by the polymerization of p-coumaryl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol andconiferyl alcohol. It is the second most abundant polymerer in the lignocellulosic biomass,and provides a barrier against foreign agents. Recalcitrance of the biomass is in great partdue to this lignin barrier (ARANTES & SADDLER, 2011). In order to prevent this effect, adelignification procedure may be applied. From a biorefinery point of view, the recuperatedlignin may be used in other processes (STEWART, 2008). Alternatively, its combustion willprovide an extra heat source to the 2G process.
To   produce   ethanol   from   these   lignocellulosic   materials   the   structural3polysaccharides must be hydrolyzed, so that their monosaccharides (mostly pentoses andhexoses)   become   available   to   fermentative   microorganisms.   However,   before   thehydrolysis   process,   a   pretreatment   is   required   to   separate   and   render   cellulose   andhemicellulose available to the hydrolytic action of the enzyme cocktail. A representation ofthe process is in Figure 1.
Figure 1 – Lignocellulosic Biomass Processing (Source: author’s collection, adapted from: SANTOS et al., 2012)2.2. BIOMASS PRETREATMENTThe   pretreatment   procedure   destabilizes   the   lignocellulosic   structure,   making   itmore   susceptible   to   further   processing.   This   is   achieved   by   increasing   the   materialporosity, reducing cellulose crystallinity and removing lignin, to a certain degree. The entireprocedure must be applied up to an intensity that generates an optimum platform forsubsequent operations, while considering the formation of inhibitors and cost effectiveness(CHIARAMONTI et al, 2012). 
Several methodologies are available for this process. Thus, the choice of the mostadequate pretreatment depends on the feedstock, process plant design and economicsituation (BANERJEE et al., 2010).
Among several available pretreatments, in this work special attention will be givento autohydrolysis,  also  know  as hydrothermal pretreatment. This procedure  requires a4pressurized reactor to maintain water in a liquid state at temperatures ranging from 150ºCto   230ºC,   for   different   time   periods.  At   these   temperatures,   biomass   suffers   cooking,increasing cellulose digestibility, while producing small amounts of inhibitors (KIM et al.,
2009). 
Another   advantage   of   this   technology   is   the   absence   of   additional   chemicalcompounds   during   the   process,   yielding   a   less   toxic   effluent   than   other   alternatives.
However,   this   pretreatment   does   not   alters   lignin   to   an   extent   that   may   render   thesemolecules   inactive   in   subsequent   processes   (MENON   &   RAO,   2012).   A   typicalcomposition of sugarcane bagasse, for the most significant compounds, before and afterthe autohydrolysis process is presented in Table 1.

(Source: Adapted from RODRIGUEZ-ZÚÑIGA et al., 2014)2.3. LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS HYDROLYSISThe   pretreated   biomass   must   be   further   hydrolyzed   to   provide   fermentablefractions. At this stage, the polymers released by the pretreatment are converted to freemonomers, readily available to fermentation.  Two mains technologies are used in order tohydrolyze lignocellulosic materials, using acid solution, generally sulfuric acid, or usingenzymatic complexes (GAMAGE et al., 2010; SUN & CHENG, 2002). 
Acid   hydrolysis   is   usually   divided   in  two   groups,   diluted   and   concentrated   acidhydrolysis. In diluted acid hydrolysis, acid concentrations range from 1 to 3% w.w -1, at hightemperatures, 200–240ºC. Due to the high temperature toxic compounds and inhibitors,such   as   furfurals   and   hydroxymethylfurfural,   are   generated   after   the   degradation   ofpentoses and hexoses . This degradation does not only decreases the hydrolysis finalyield, but the generated compounds are toxic to further production stages, such as thefermentation process (LIMAYEM & RICKE, 2012). 
5Concentrated acid is a more common process methodology. In this operation theacid concentration is high and, therefore, temperatures can be lower. Thus, this processgenerates   a   smaller   amount   of   inhibitors.   However,   the   utilization   of   such   high   acidconcentrations is costly, and also generates a highly toxic effluent (SUN & CHENG, 2002).
This leads to the necessity for a more economically and environmental suitableprocess.   One   alternative   is   enzymatic   hydrolysis.   This   sort   of   procedure   yields   highconversions, with fewer risks of producing toxic secondary products (LIMAYEM & RICKE,2012). However, a high cost is inherent to this process, since, the compound itself has ahigh value and, with the current technology, direct enzymatic complex reuse is not feasiblewhen using a soluble enzymatic complex (DANTAS et al., 2013).
To   introduce   enzymatic   hydrolysis   into   the   ethanol   production   route   severalresearch routes are explored, among them: enzymatic complex improvement (KUPSKI etal.,   2013);   implementations   of   the   second   generation   technology   alongside   the   firstgeneration   process   (FURLAN   et   al.,   2012);   utilizing   high   substrate   loading;   hydrolysisoptimization modifying the feeding policy to the reactor in a fed-batch process (HODGE etal., 2009; CAVALCANTI-MONTAÑO et al., 2013).
2.3.1. Modeling Enzymatic Lignocellulosic Biomass HydrolysisTo   optimize   the   bioreactor   design   and   operational   conditions   it   is   necessary   tounderstand the kinetics that commands the interaction of the lignocellulosic material andthe enzymatic complex. This study is difficult since several effects are reported amongsubstrate and catalyst (SOUSA JR et al., 2011). To cope with such complexity, a largenumber of models are proposed to elucidate this process behavior.
Different   approaches   are   used   to   model   the   process.  A  summary   of   them   ispresented in Table 2.
Analysis of Table 2 indicates that the model choice must be based on the goal to beachieved. As the model's phenomenological foundation increases, so does its complexity,generating the necessity for more specific data. However, for some reactive systems itmay be unpractical—or even unfeasible—to measure all significant effects, necessary tovalidate more complex models. For a macro analysis of an industrial process, these detailsmay not even be significant at all. Thus an adequate tradeoff between available data andmodel complexity must be sought.

Models   of   this   category   reflect   some—at   least   rough—understanding   of   thephenomena   occurring   in   the   system,   though   only   using   relative   simple   data,   such   asproduct concentration throughout time, for model fitting and validation. This class of modelis generally applied for optimization and designing industrial reactors (CARVALHO et al.,
2013). 
The most popular semi-mechanistic models for enzymatic reactions  are derivationsof Michaelis-Menten’s (Michaelis & Menten, 1913). However, Michaelis-Menten model isbased on mass action laws valid for substrates (and products) in the fluid (liquid, in thiscase) phase. This is not true for the specific case of lignocellulosic hydrolysis, since mostof the substrate is solid. The excess substrate to enzyme condition ([S]>>[E]), necessaryto the quasi-steady state condition, is also never achieved, since the fraction of celluloseavailable to hydrolysis is not high enough. This derives from the fact that hydrolysis occursin a heterogeneous medium, and the reaction is occurring on the substrate surface, so theenzyme must first diffuse to the reactive site to be able to act (BANSAL et al., 2009). 
7Nevertheless, literature has shown that Michaelis-Menten models may be suitableto fit experimental results of the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials, despite the lack ofphysical-chemical background. Yet, in order to use this type of model some assumptionregarding the substrate solid state must be established. Two options are available in theliterature: using a pseudo-homogenous assumption for the solid substrate (Equation 1). Or
using a modified form of the model, which assumes that the soluble enzyme attacks thesolid substrate, but with negligible changes of the substrate initial concentration (Equation2);   the   soluble   enzyme   has   to   absorb   (and   desorb)   from   the   solid   substrate.   Theconcentration   of   enzyme   absorbed   on   the   substrate   must   be   much   smaller   than   theamount free in the medium ([E]>>[Eads])  (CARVALHO et al., 2013).
v= k⋅[ E]⋅[S]( K m+[S])               Equation 1v= k⋅[ E]⋅[S]( K m+[E])Where,   v   is the reaction rate,   k   is the enzyme turnover number,   [ E]   is theenzyme concentration,   [S]   is the substrate concentration and   K m   is the Michaelis-Menten half-saturation constant. 
Equation 2Both models are showed to be able of fitting hydrolysis data. However, they do notaccount   for   inhibitors   present   in   the   process.   Bezerra   &   Dias   (2004)   showed   that   apseudo-homogenous   model   with   competitive   inhibition   by   the   product   was   the   mostsuitable model in this case, as other effects that may reduce hydrolysis rates, such asnonproductive cellulase binding, enzyme jamming and enzyme deactivation were not sosignificant,   according   to   these   authors.   Following   this   approach,   Equation   1   can   bemodified into Equation 3.
k⋅[ E]⋅[S]K m⋅(1+ [ P]K icv=              Equation 3)+[S]Where   K ic   is the competitive inhibition constant. Even though this is a rathersimplified model, it is expected from the literature results that this structure may hold forthe conditions that will be studied in this work. 
8The same consideration of competitive inhibition can be applied to Equation 2, togenerate a modified Michaelis-Menten model with product inhibition.

Enzymatic ComplexDue to the high complexity of the lignocellulosic material, the enzymatic catalystused for biomass hydrolysis is not composed by only one active protein, but by a congressof several molecules, each interacting with a portion of the substrate.
The   enzymes   that   interact   with   cellulose   to   produce   glucose   are   denominatedcellulases. Cellulases are enzymatic complexes that may be produced by fermentation offilamentous   fungi   from   the   genre  Trichoderma,  Aspergillus   and   Penicillum  (WYMAN,2003). 
Cellulases   are   divided   in   three   main   groups.   Endoglucanases   (endo-1,4-β-glucanase) work in the amorphous region of the cellulose molecule and binds randomly,liberating reductive ends in the chain. Celobiohydrolases (exo-1,4-β-glucanase) act in thereducing   and   non-reducing   ends   of   the   chain,   both   e   natural   ones,   and   on   the   onesgenerated by Endoglucanases. The last group is composed by  β-glucosidases and itsfunction   is   to   hydrolyze   cellobiose   into   glucose   (THONGEKKAEW   et   al,   2008).   Otherenzymes may be used as addictives to enhance the performance of the cocktail. Oxidasessuch as lytic polysaccharides monooxygenases are one example (HORN et al., 2012).
Residual hemicellulose, that was preserved in the solid substrate after the pre-treatment of the biomass, can be hydrolyzed by the action of a group of enzymes know as α-L-Hemicellulases.
arabinofuranosidase, among others (JORGENSEN et al., 2007).
 β-xylanes   and  endoxylanases,them   are:  Among  All these enzymes are commonly found in commercial cocktails, although the exactcomposition of such complexes is not disclosed.
2.4. HIGH SOLIDS ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSISThe   so   called   C6   liquor,   essentially   glucose   for   further   fermentation   (withSaccharomyces cerevisiae), is the output of the enzymatic bioreactor, where cellulose9hydrolysis occurs. For the economics of the overall processes, it is very important thatglucose   is   yielded   at   high   concentrations,   thus   reducing   the   amount   of   water   in   thesolution. Ideally, for sugar cane mills, the target should be minimizing the energy demandby   reaching   glucose   concentrations   as   close   as   possible   to   the   sugarcane   juice’s,aproximally 180 g.L ¹ (FERNANDES, 2003). Either if the C6 liquor is used in separatefermenters or if it is mixed with the sugarcane juice, a concentrated C6 liquor will reducethe demand of heating power in the global process (DIAS et al., 2012; FURLAN et al.,
2012).
⁻Thus, a high solid consistency (load of substrate within the reactor) is necessary,generating   a   more   concentrated   carbohydrate   solution   at   the   end   of   the   process.  Aspreviously mentioned, a more concentrated final product would enable the addition of the2G stream to the 1G’s, before the fermentation (HUMBIRD et al., 2010), without (or withminimal) demand of evaporators after the hydrolysis reactor. High-solids loadings alsogenerate economical advantages since the operational volume will be lower than with low-solids operation, resulting in less energy to heat or cool the reactor. Disposal treatmentcosts would be lower too, due to the reduction of water usage (HODGE et al., 2009).
High solids processes are those where the ratio of solid material to aqueous phaseis such that very little free liquid is present (HODGE et al.,   2009). As water becomessparse within the reactor two main issues arise. Water is first and foremost necessary inorder to provide a medium in which the chemical reaction will take place. At high solidscontent, mass transfer becomes an issue, since the enzyme will be hindered to reachingits reactive site (MODENBACH & NOKES, 2013).
The   second   issue   is   the   reactive   medium   apparent   viscosity.   Water   dilutes   thesolids   inside   the   reactor,   effectively   decreasing   viscosity,   and   increasing   the   lubricitybetween the particles. A larger lubricity decreases the required shear rate to agitate thereactor. A smaller agitation necessity leads to smaller power consumption. Therefore, athigh solids rates, reactor mixing becomes an issue, due to the high power demanded(KRISTENSEN et al., 2009). Thus, it would be interesting to have a reactor operationalpolicy that would bypass such conditions.
2.5. BIOMASS HYDROLYSIS IN SEMI-CONTINUOUS OPERATIONSBiomass hydrolysis in fed-batch processes appears as a promising strategy sinceadverse conditions of a standard batch are avoided. A process policy where substrate is10fed into the reactor continuously avoids the necessity of beginning the process with highsolid loadings, facilitating the system homogenization. Furthermore, in fed-batch process,when compared to the same process done in a standard batch process, the conversionand   productivity   is   higher,   since   smaller   solid   loadings   diminish   inhibitions,   especiallyenzyme/substrate inhibitions (HODGE et al., 2009).
Studies for the optimization of fed-batch processes may begin by promoting batchhydrolyses under high-solids concentrations, when stirring and mixing in the tank maybecome   a   problem   (HODGE   et   al.,   2008).  After   the   reactor   model   is   consolidated,alterations are made in order to contemplate the feeding flow (HODGE et al., 2009). 
Most of the published studies deal with spreading the initial substrate load evenlyduring  the batch time,  and do not propose optimum  profiles (CHANDRA  et  al.,  2011;GUPTA et al., 2012). This implementation does not optimize the system, and may notmaximize its performance. Optimal control theory (dynamic optimization) may be appliedto maximize productivity and minimize the utilization of enzymatic complex (CAVALCANTI-MONTAÑO et al., 2013).  A   summary   of   previous   literature   results   in   the   subject   ispresented in Table 3.
Table 3 brings important points to the discussion. The work of Chandra et al. (2011)is the only presented research that does not demonstrate an improvement with the fed-batch system when compared with a standard batch. This work also is the only one thatdoes not alters enzyme complex concentration  throughout the process, indicating thatthere   can   be   a   relation   between   the   enzyme   feeding   profile   and   fed-batch/batchimprovement .
Another important characteristic is that none of the cited works considers the powerdemands   for   stirring   within   the   reactor.   The   papers   do   not   consider   how   the   solidsconcentration will influence the reactor operation cost, and when the solid concentration isconsidered, the value is related to the reactor operational range, and not related to someindex indicating the performance of the process. Nevertheless, as it will be shown further,it   is   imperative   to   consider   the   agitation   power,   and   how   it   is   changed   by   solidsconcentration, for the optimization of the process.

OPTIMAL CONTROLThe optimal control problem (or dynamic optimization) consists in, basically, findingcontrol variables  optimum  profiles (several decisions dynamics), control parameters orproject   variables   values   (static   variables)   and   possibly   the   process   final   time   thatmaximizes   (or   minimize)   a   performance   scalar   (objective   function   or   cost   function)(RIBEIRO & GIORDANO, 2005; RAMIREZ, 2004). The direct formulation of the optimalcontrol problem is as follows (SRINIVASAN et al., 2003):min(u(t ), p , t )J (u , p)=ψ(x(t f ), p ,t f )Equation 5Subjected to:˙x=f ( x(t),u(t), p, t)                x(t 0)=x0Equation 612g( x (t), u(t ), p ,t )=0S(x (t),u(t), p)≤0             T ( x(t f))≤x0Equation 7Equation 8By   minimizing,   or   maximizing,   the   functional,   or   cost   function,   J   under   theconstraints and weights given by the other equations an optimum profile for the controlvariable may be calculated (RAMIREZ, 2004).
Where J is the functional, or cost function,  x(t)  is the state variables vector, andx0  is the, usually known initial conditions,  u(t )  is the control variable profile throughouttime,  g  is the equality constraint vector,  S  is the inequality constraint vector and  p  arestatic decision variables.
There are several methods to calculate the optimum solution. The solution methodvaries with how the state and input variables are handled, and how the numerical solutionis   carried   out.   The   functional   presented   in   Equation   5   may   be   optimized   in   a   directapproach, by  using an  optimization algorithm,  or indirect approach,  by using methodsbased in variational calculus such as the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and the principleof optimality of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SRINIVASAN et al., 2003). 
A simple method for solving the optimal control problem stated (Equations 5–8) isthe   sequential   approach.   In   contrast   to   indirect   approaches,   in   this   direct   method   noanalytical differentiation  is needed and  it is an adjoint-free  computation,  i.e. no  adjoinvariables (Lagrange multipliers) has to be calculate. In this method however, the controlvector,  u(t) must be parameterized using a finite set of parameters—the actual decisionvariables. Though this method is easy to implement, it tends to be slow, especially wheninequality path constraints are included in the problem. (SRINIVASAN et al., 2003).
2.7. ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS FED-BATCH OPTIMAL CONTROL It should be stressed that the definition of the functional, or cost function, is a keystep to have a well-posed optimal control problem. Defining reasonable criteria to evaluatethe “optimality” of a specific solution in real life is probably the most challenging task forthe process engineer that is implementing optimal control algorithms. 
In the special case of lignocellulosic hydrolysis, some possible performance indexesare:   productivity   per   enzyme   mass,   fermentable   carbohydrates   conversion,   finalcarbohydrates concentration, some economical index related with the operational cost of13the bioreactor with the selling price of bioethanol. The dynamic control variables may bethe mass inflow of substrate and of enzymatic complex.
Most optimal control techniques presented in the literature for biomass hydrolysisare open loop, no method for information feedback is used. That is, the optimal policiesare previously computed, assuming that the real process will not deviate greatly from themodel predictions. Thus, disturbances originated from several sources, such as substratecomposition variations or errors in secondary control systems, are not corrected by thecontrol software (UPETRI, 2013). To consider these variations it is necessary to close thecontrol loop, enabling the automatic update of control profiles based on the current stateand future possibilities.
The   feedback   of   data   gives   the   control   layer   capabilities   for   dealing   withuncertainties,   not   considered   in   the   internal   models.   Previously   determined   kineticparameters   may   then   be   re-estimated,   and   optimum   trajectories   of   the   system,recalculated. The feedback may generate a better performance when comparing to openoptimization. However, a closed-loop control mesh may render the system more sensitiveto external variations. This comes from the fact that, to maintain the system optimized, thecontroller   distributes   the   error   into   the   controlled   values   by   intensifying   activationsdensities. This effect generates a stress in the component, since more activations arenecessary (NAGY & BRAATZ, 2004).
Commonly, the update of optimal profiles for fed-batch processes is translated intochanges   in   the   feeding   streams   to   the   reactor.   This   is   especially   the   case   whentemperature is not an adequate variable to be manipulated, following profiles that changewith time: certainly, this is not a desirable strategy for an enzymatic reactor, since thecatalytic action of the enzymes is restrict to narrow ranges of temperature. Essentially, thiskind of reactor will be operated isothermally, in a temperature where the enzyme activity ishigh, while thermal inactivation is not significant. Although, this approach may be improved(considering thermal profiles during operation of the reactor), in this work the reactor willbe isothermal (the temperature closed loop feedback control runs in standalone feature,with a fixed set point).
Besides   temperature,   other   secondary   variables   may   be   manipulated   by   thedynamic control algorithm. One example is  the agitation. 
142.8. ONLINE FERMENTABLE CARBOHYDRATES DETERMINATIONIn the hydrolysis of the cellulose fraction of the biomass, the desired products arefree   carbohydrates,   especially   glucose.   Therefore,   to   optimize   this   compound   finalconcentration, a methodology capable of predicting concentrations of this substance onlineis necessary. Several methods can be applied to quantify them, ranging from titration andcolorimetric techniques to chromatographic analysis (SLUITER et al., 2010).
Nevertheless, these techniques are used in laboratory scale, demanding qualifiedoperators and a relatively long time (DEMARTINI et al., 2011). Therefore, usual analyticaltechniques are not suitable to online monitoring, and more suitable methods must bedeveloped, able to be used within an automated supervision/control framework.
A possible alternative to monitor fermentable carbohydrates is the utilization of softsensing to infer the state of the system. In a softsensor, a set of measurements, obtainedfrom different sensors, are the input for a model (usually empirical, black box) whoseoutput is the inference of the variable of interest. Although extrapolation is not expected tobe accurate with this kind of model, the accuracy and precision of the predictions musthold when a set of input values is not contained in the original experimental data (but iswithin the range of the data used for tuning the softsensor). Among the most popular softsensing algorithms are: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) combined with  Least PartialSquare   (LPS)   regression;  Artificial   Neural   Networks   (ANN);   and   Neuro-Fuzzy   systems(NF) (KADLEC et al., 2009). 
Artificial   Neural   Networks   (ANNs)   are   mathematical   models   inspired   by   themechanism that the human brain uses to handle information. One important application ofANNs   is   patter   recognition.  Among   several   types   of  ANN   architectures,   the   multilayerperceptrons   (MLP)   can   be   highlighted.   In   this   architecture   each   artificial   neuron   isconnected to all the neurons in the following layer, the input for each neuron is multipliedby   a   weight   value   and   then   it   is   introduced   into   a   transfer   function.   The   networkcomposition is carried by a training stage using an optimization method to minimize theerror between the model output and the experimental value, using independent test datasets (not applied in the tuning of the ANN parameters) to avoid overfitting. After training,the network may be applied to predict the value of the monitored variable from the primary,directly measurable, variables (DEHURI & CHO, 2009). 
152.8.1. Torque MeasurementTorque   is   an   important   variable   when   analyzing   the   rheometry   of   a  solution   orsuspension. Usually, torque measurement is done off-line: a sample of the medium isloaded in a bench rheometer (EHRHARDT et al., 2010). 
In studies that monitor rheometry throughout the enzymatic hydrolysis process, aclear decrease in the torque demanded to agitate the medium is observed when the solidsin the reactor are hydrolyzed (SAMANIUK et al., 2011) However, these authors did notmeasure the torque online. Using a system capable of monitoring the torque throughoutthe process may enable solids monitoring, and this measured data can be used in the softsensor.
2.8.2. Visible and Ultraviolet SpectroscopyAn analytical online system, capable of analyzing the supernatant optical properties,alongside the hydrolysis reactor, can uncover new behaviors of the hydrolysis kinetics.
Specially the presence of inhibitors of the enzyme complex within the reactor may bedetected. 
This  idea  is  supported  by the  fact  that  lignin absorbs  electromagnetic  radiationstrongly in the ultraviolet region. Some methodologies use this characteristic in order toascertain lignin contents in the biomass (NREL, 2008; GOUVEIA et al., 2009; KLINE et al.,
2010).
Thus, an instrumentation capable of measuring lignin, as well as other possibleanalytes, can be feedback into the controller unit in order to generate the input of the softsensor, and provide information (including inhibitors concentrations) to re-parametrize thekinetic model used by the optimal control algorithm.
2.8.3. Conductance/Capacitance SpectroscopyConductance and Capacitance Spectroscopy (CCS) is based on the generation ofalternating electrical fields in the media (inside the reactor, in our case). Thus, the CCSsensor   is   an  in   situ  measuring   device.   Under   certain   frequencies,   some   groups   ofmolecules are polarized. This polarization changes the dielectric constant of the medium.
This can be measured as variations in the conductance, the capacity of the medium toallow   an   electrical   current   to   pass   through   itself,   and   capacitance,   the   capacity   of   amedium to store electrical charge (VOJINOVIC et al., 2006).
16CCS   has   been   recently   reported   for   monitoring   the   hydrolysis   of   lignocellulosicmaterial by Bryant et al., 2013 who observed a linear correlation between capacitance thecontents of solids inside the reactor.
Therefore,   an   instrument   of   this   sort  can   be  used  to  aid  the   monitoring  of   thereactor, either as a standalone instrument or as a source of input signals to the soft sensorlayer.
173. MATERIALS AND METHODS3.1. ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSISBagasse was donated by Usina Ipiranga S/A (Descalvado, SP) in July 16th  2014,and it is the product of milling sugar cane used to extract the high carbohydrate contentjuice from this vegetable. The bagasse was then dried, to a humidity   close to 5%, andfreezed at – 7 ºC. 
Batch and fed-batch enzymatic hydrolysis were performed utilizing hydrothermallypretreated sugar cane bagasse. The pretreatment was carried out in pressurized reactor,with a maximum pressure of 13 Bar, at 200 RPM. The reactor was loaded with 0.10 gramsof dry bagasse per milliliter of reactor (10 % w.v ¹⁻ ) and then programmed to reach 195 ºCand hold this temperature for 10 min. The pretreated bagasse was then dried in kiln for24h at 60 ºC. This methodology was predetermined with the research group.
⁻The batch experiments were realized using 10 % w.v ¹ of dry pretreated bagassesuspended in 4.80 pH and 50 mM citrate buffer and 50 ºC (WANG  et al., 2012).  Thehydrolysis was carried out in stirred vessel containing 3 L of reactive media in a 5 Lcontainer. The reactor was stirred at 470 RPM by a pair of Elephant Ear impellers, bothequally distributed between the vessel bottom and the liquid surface. Temperature insidethe reactor was maintained using a thermostatic water bath set to 50 ºC. The total batchtime was 48 h and manual analysis were performed at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 12.0,
24.0, 36.0 and 48.0 h. 
The enzymatic complex used was Cellic Ctec 2®  donated by Novozymes LatinAmerica (Araucária, PR). In the batch experiments, 1.04 g (13.84 mL) were added, thismass is equivalent to a loading of   10 FPU.g Bagasse ¹, which is the operational load instudies within the research group. Filter Paper Unity (FPU) is the unit used in order tomeasure cellulase hydrolysis potential.
⁻The fed-batch experiments were performed with similar conditions to those of batchexperiments, 4.80 pH and 50 mM citrate buffer and 50ºC. However, the substrate and  theenzymatic complex were not added in the beggining of the process, but, however, fed tothe reactor following a feeding profile, presented in Table 4. The experiments lasted for 6h.
The substrate feeding was carried out with a solids concentration of 40% in the inlet flow.
The reactor initial volume was 3 L and was filled until 3.5 L. 
18Two experiments were performed for each strategy. Manual samples were taken 2minutes before and 2 minutes after each feeding instant.

3.2. MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEMThis   work   proposes   the   dimensioning   and   construction   of   a   system   capable   ofmonitoring,   translating   the   data   from   a   sensor   array   into   a   product   concentrationprediction, evaluating the reaction state and optimizing further activations to maximize theprocess efficiency. A schematic of how the system works is presented in Figure 2. 
Further explanations on how the systems interact are contained in the followingitems.
19Figure 2 - Monitoring and control system(Source: author’s collection) 3.3. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS The reactor where the hydrolysis happens possesses an instrumentation array withthe purpose of monitoring the free glucose concentration inside the reactive media at anygiven time during the hydrolysis process. The sensors measurements are relayed to aserver that decodes the information, converts to the interest variable unit of measurementwhen necessary and stores the data. 
Figure 3 presents a scheme of the system sensors.
20Figure 3 - Sensor array coupling(Source: author’s collection) 3.3.1. Torque Measurement The torque measurement was achieved using digital dynamometer coupled to thestirring shaft. The electric motor was above a ball bearing mount, thus the engine was freeto roll in its own axle. By coupling a dynamometer perpendicularly to a rod fixated in theball bearing a force was measured. This force is proportional to the amount of energynecessary to agitate the reactive media. To convert the straight force into stirring power,Equation 9 was used.
P=T⋅ωEquation 9Where   P,   is   the   power   necessary   for   the   stirring   motion,   T   is   the   torquemeasurement itself and ω is the axle angular velocity. Torque may be substituted by the21variables in Equation 10.
T=F⋅LEquation 10Where  F  is   the   force  provided   by  the   dynamometer  and   L  the  distance  of   thedynamometer   coupling   to   the   center   of   the   agitation   axle.   Further   modifications   areprovided by Equation 11.
ω=2⋅π⋅NEquation 11Where N is the rotation frequency, results in a simplification to convert the forcemeasured by the dynamometer into stirring power presented in Equation 12.
P=2⋅π⋅F⋅L⋅NEquation 12This instrument relays data through a serial connection to a server under a RS-232protocol. The server receives this information through a universal serial bus (USB) portand handles the data in a software layer inside a Python console. This measurement wasmade at 20 seconds of the batch.
3.3.2. Supernatant Sampling and ScanThe supernatant optical properties was measured by an analytical line once anhour. The supernatant sampling begins with the filtration of the reactive media by a pumicestone filter. The driving force for the filtration was provided by a peristaltic pump. Part ofthe   filtrated   supernatant,   0.2   mL,   was   destined   to   a   dilution   vessel.  The   dilution   wasaccomplished   by   a   series   of   valves   and   a   peristaltic   pump.   The   dilution   line   workediteratively, adding 4.0 mL per iteration, and the sample dilution necessity was assessed bythe last scan, updating itself automatically. 
After the dilution, the prepared sample was injected into a flow cuvette inside thespectrophotometer. With the sample properly contained, 20 scans ranging from 190 to1100 nm was performed. This range comprehends the ultra violet and visible region of theelectromagnetic spectrum. The data generated by the scans were transmitted to the serverby a serial connection, under a RS-232 protocol, and the server received the informationthrough a USB port and decoded by a software layer operating in a Python console.
At the end of the scans, dilution water was injected into the cuvette to clean it. Afterthe cleaning period, only water was added to the cuvette and 5 scans were performed toestablish a baseline for the next series of scans.
22The automation of sampling system was accomplished by a physical computationaldevice for data acquisition called Arduino. The Arduino board is an open hardware platformcapable of generating electronic outputs or reading inputs in a standalone method or as aslave   for   a   server   (BANZI,   2009).   The   signals   to   change   the   controller   states   aregenerated by a software layer coded and run in a Python console.
3.3.3. Conductivity and Capacitance MeasurementThe conductivity and capacitance measurements was performed by a single probeconnected to a preamplifier and transmission module Fogale Nanobiotech. The frequencyused was 382 kHz.
3.3.4. Enzymatic Hydrolysis Monitoring Through ConductivitySmall-scale studies were carried out to assess how the conductivity changes insidethe hydrolysis media and evaluate this methodology as a tool to monitor hydrolysis insidethe reactor before adding this instrumentation a larger reactor. Three small-scale batchexperiments were conducted in a 500 mL reactor, with conditions similar to the large-scaleexperiments. Citrate buffer at 4.80 pH and 50 mM, 10% w.v ¹ dry bagasse, 50 ºC andadding 0.17 g of enzymatic complex.   In these experiments, the probe relayed its datathrough a serial RS-232 connection and the decoding was achieved by the proprietarysoftware (FOGALE NANOTECH BIOMASS+ v 1.0). 
⁻In the larger scales, the rest of the instrumentation was applied, however whenusing the capacitance/conductivity system inside the 3L reactor the acquired data by thisprobe was relayed to the server through  a 4 to 20 mA connection. The signal was read bythe data acquisition module Arduino Mega through two analog input ports, and then thedata was relayed to the server via serial RS-232 connection. 
3.4. CARBOHYDRATES DETERMINATIONGlucose determination was carried out manually at the offline sampling periodsdescribed   in   the   Item   3.1.   The   analysis   itself   was   performed   via   glucoseoxidase/peroxidase enzymatic determination kit (Doles; Goiânia, GO, Brazil) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  (HPLC). 
The samples were withdrawn from the reactor by filling a 2 mL vessel with reactivemedia. The container was centrifuged for 7 min at 10,000 RPM. 0.5 mL of the supernatantwas combined with 0.1 mL of sodium hydroxide 0.2 N to maintain storage preservation.
23HPLC was used to determinate glucose, xylose and cellobiose concentrations. Thesamples   were   analyzed   in   Shimadzu   SCL-10A  chromatograph   using   refraction   indexdetector RID10-A, Animex HPX-87H Bio-rad, using as mobile phase sulfuric acid 5 mM ata flow of 0.6 mL.min ¹. The samples were compared to previously established standards(NREL, 2008).
⁻Enzymatic   kit   analysis   was   used   to   check   HPLC   glucose   concentration.   Theanalysis occurred by combining 10 μmL of the prepared sample and 1 mL of the enzymaticanalysis complex, incubating the mixture at 37ºC for 5 min and measuring the absorbanceat 510 nm. The measured absorbance was compared to a standard curve of glucosedetermined with the kit in the same manner that the sample is analyzed. All analyses wereperformed in triplicates. 
3.5. COMPOUNDS BALANCE AND MODEL FITTINGIn order to estimate parameters and optimize feeding strategies, a global massbalance for the reactor and each compound was developed.
Given that the reactor is presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4 – Reactor Schematics and Inflows(Source: Author's collection)For the the presented schematics, the global mass balance is as follows:dmdt= ˙mIEquation 14˙mI   is the mass inflow (g.min ¹) of both substrate (solids) and enzymatic⁻Where  complex. 
24The measurement of volumes and densities of the humid bagasse substrate is notstraightforward.   The   substrate   is   a   slurry   of   pretreated   bagasse   and   water.   Here,   toemulate the substrate feed in an industrial process, the substrate was dried and citratebuffer (50 mM, pH 4.8) was  added, in quantitative amounts (masses).
The reaction medium consists of solids (that will be liquefied) dispersed in a liquidphase. As a first approximation, the variation of density of the liquid in the reaction medium(due to the liquefaction of the solid substrate into soluble products) was neglected. In otherwords, the density of the liquid medium was assumed constant, and equal to the water(the density of the enzymatic complex was also assumed equal to water's). In order tosimplify the model, we assume as control volume only the liquid phase inside the reactor.
Of course, these hypotheses can be refined, using empirical correlations for the apparentdensities, but this approach will be left as a suggestion for the continuation of the presentwork. Thus the global mass balance becomes:F SF EdVdt= ˙V=+Equation 15[E]Inflow[S]InflowWhere FS is the mass inflow of dry substrate (in g.min ¹), ⁻[S]Inflow is the mass of drysolids divided by the water in the inflow (with 40 % of solids in the inflow feed stream,[S]Inflow becomes 666 gDry Solids.LWater ¹), ⁻[E]Inflowis the concentration of total protein in the enzymatic complex in the inflow stream (in g.L ¹,⁻FE is the mass inflow of enzyme (in g.min ¹), ⁻˙V  (L.min ¹) is the volumetric reactor inflow⁻⁻the used value was 75.71 g.L ¹), and .
The substrate mass balance is presented in equation 3.
dSdt=F S−REquation 16Where S is the solid substrate mass in the reactor, R is the rate of disappearance of⁻substrate   (gSubstrate.min ¹).   The   balance   can   be   described   in   terms   of   substrateconcentration as follows.
d (V⋅[S])=F S⋅SG−S−v .V
Equation 17dt⁻Where V is the reactor volume (L), v is the reaction volumetric rate (in g.L ¹.min ¹),[S]  is  the  substrate  concentration  in  terms  of  potential glucose  (g.L ¹),  and   SG­S  is  a⁻⁻25⁻pseudo-stoichiometric ratio (cellulose content in the solids, 0.55 w.w ¹, multiplied by thehydrolysis stoichiometric ratio between glucose and cellulose, 1.10 wglucose.wcellulose ¹). Thisequation can be further modified:⁻+V⋅d[ S]dt[S]⋅dVdtSubstituting the global mass balance (Equation 2), Equation 5 becomes:=F S⋅SS−G−v.V
Equation 18FS⋅SS−G−v−[ S]⋅ ˙VVd [S]dt=Equation 19VThe product mass balance follows:dPdt=+REquation 20Where P is the product mass inside the reactor. The balance can be described interms of product concentration:d (V⋅[ P])=+v⋅VEquation 21dtWhere  [P]  is the product concentration inside the reactor (g.L ¹). Substituting the⁻global mass balance (Equation 2), and modifying it, the product balance becomes:=+v− [P]⋅ ˙VVd⋅[ P]Equation 22dtThe enzyme mass balance follows:d (V⋅[ E])=F EEquation 23dtWhere  [E]  is the enzyme concentration inside the reactor (g.L ¹). This equation,⁻after modifications and using the global mass balance as:F EV−[ E]⋅ ˙VVd [E ]dt=Equation 24The   mass   balance   for   the   solids   suspended   in   the   reactor   must   consider   theproduction of coproducts (xylose and cellobiose), besides glucose:26d (V⋅[Sol ])=FS−V⋅[v( 1SG−C+Xyl+Cell)]Equation 25dtWhere  [Sol]  is the solids concentration inside the reactor,  SG-C  is the hydrolysisstoichiometric   ratio   between   glucose   and   cellulose,   1.10   wglucose.wcellulose ¹,  ⁻Xyl  is   thepseudo-stoichiometric,   empirical   ratio   between   the   rates   of   formation   of   xylose   andglucose   and  Cell  is   the   pseudo-stoichiometric,   empirical   ratio   between   the   rates   offormation   of   cellobiose   and   glucose.   With   further   modification,   the   solids   balancebecomes:FSV+v⋅Xyl+v⋅Cell−[S]⋅ ˙VVd⋅[ Sol]− vSG−C=Equation 26dtEquations 15, 19, 22, 24 and 26 are the equations used in the following items asthe compounds balance.
The   stoichiometric   rates   were   adjusted   with   the   data   provided   by   thechromatographic analysis. The xylose and cellobiose concentrations are estimated from alinear fitting of these compounds and the glucose concentration. This procedure is carriedseparately for the batch and fed-batch experiments.
To avoid inconsistencies in the numerical solving of the model, the feeding profilecannot be a discrete vector with punctual in certain time instants. Therefore, the vectorwas interpolated to a continuous function throughout the time domain. A representation ofthis interpolation is presented in Figure 5. 
27Figure 5 - Interpolation Example(Source: author’s collection)  (Where: Discrete feedings (kg) at certain time instants wereapproximated to a continuous flow (kg.h ¹))⁻In   the   Fig.   4,   the   blue   circles   represent   the   discrete   values   (optimized   feedingvectors)   and   the   blue   solid   line   represents   the   generated   continuous   function.   Theinterpolation  algorithm  behaved  equally  for  the  bagasse  and  enzymatic complex  inputprofiles.
The numerical method used to integrate the differential system was a Runge-Kutta4th order with variable step. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to fitthe parameters.
PSO minimizes the average quadratic error between the system output and theexperimental   value   (cost   function   chosen)   by   generating   a   series   of   particles.   Theseparticles are scattered in a multidimensional space, with as many dimensions as there areparameters   to   be   optimized,   in   this   case   a   3   dimensions   space.  A  velocity   in   eachdimension is attributed to the particle. Since the dimensions are the parameters to beoptimized, one particle position is tested inside the model to evaluate its fitting. If the newfitting is better (smaller error) than a previous one found by the same particle (PersonalBest) the new position is attributed as a new best particular position. The fitting value is28also compared to a Global Best, which is the best value and position achieved by anyparticle.  After   the   comparison   stage,   the   particles   velocities   are   updated   to   make   theparticles converge to the best global and individual fitting. To fully emulate a swarm, thevelocities are also regulated by a Momentum parameter. The Momentum decreases witheach iteration, simulating fatigue within the particles in a moment when they should benear the minimum value (KARIMI et al., 2012). An explanatory pseudocode containing thedescribed numeric procedure is presented in Table 5.

The   social   parameters   (KENEDY   &   EBERHART,   2001)  c1  and  c2responsible   for   the   weighting   in   the   velocities   update   were   set   to   2.00   and   2.10
respectively. The equation that updates the velocity is presented in Equation 27.
vk+1=vk+c1∗rand()∗( pbest−xk)+c2∗rand ()∗(gbest−xk)Equation 27Where, vk  is the particle's velocity, vk+1  is the next position, rand( ) is a random29number between 0 and 1, pbest is the particle's velocity with the best fitting, gbest is theposition that obtained the best fitting among all particle's and xk  is the particle's currentposition. The position update is presented in Equation 28.
xk+1=xk+M⋅vkEquation 28Where, xk+1 is the particle's next position and M the particle's momentum.
The momentum parameter was initially set to 0.99. However, after all the particle'svelocities were updated, this parameter was decreased until it reached a value lower than0.20, after this point the momentum was reinitialized to 0.99, and positions randomizationwere performed. This approach is necessary to relocate the swarm from a possible localminimal point.
After the optimization procedure ends, the confidence interval for each adjustedmodel is calculated. An approximate confidence region can be calculated using Equation29 (HIMMELBLAU, 1970).
2⋅F1−α[m,n−m]C . R .=s ^Y iEquation 292Where  C.R.  is the confidence region range,   s^Y i  is  the  standard error for eachparameter,  F1-α  is   the   upper   limit   of   the   F-distribution,  m  is   the   number   ofparameters and n is the number of experimental data points.
The contour for the sum of squares surface can be calculated accordingto Equation 30.
φ=φmin{1+ m⋅F1−α[m,n−m]}Equation 30(n−m)Where ϕ is the squared error threshold for the region, if a parameters group has asquared error value higher than this value it is considered outside the confidence error andϕmin is the squared error for the optimized parameter (HIMMELBLAU, 1970).
The entire procedure follows the dynamic demonstrated in the Figure 6.
30Figure 6 - Model Fitting Flowchart(Source: author’s collection) 3.6. FED-BATCH OPTIMIZATIONWith the optimized models and its optimized parameters, Equations 15, 19, 22, 24and 26 presented in item 3.5 were used to optimize the feeding strategy. The mass flowwere   subjected   to  an   optimization  method,   where  the   profiles,   both  for  substrate   andenzymatic complex, changed at each iteration until an optimum bagasse and enzymaticcomplex addition is achieved. 
The sequential approach and PSO algorithm, described in the previous item, wereused   to   solve   the   optimal   control   problem.   Therefore,   the  input   flow   had   to   beparameterized. Vectors with equal amount of points for bagasse and enzyme additionwere created. The first value is the initial compound addition, and the other points areadditions throughout the process.
For each evaluated feeding profiles, an integration of the fed-batch product balanceis realized. The performance of the simulated feeding profile was evaluated by convertingthe   final   carbohydrate   concentration   into   potential   ethanol,   via   theoretical   maximumstoichiometric coefficient, and subtracting from the revenue of selling this product the cost31of the enzymatic complex and electrical power necessary to agitate the reactor. This valueis divided by the total mass of bagasse added in the process in order to generate arevenue   related   to   the   added   mass   (US$.kgBagasse ¹).   Hence   the   objective   functionbecomes:⁻t f PStirringmEthanol⋅P Ethanol−mEnzyme⋅PEnzyme−P Power∫t 0EquationPI ( US $kgbagasseWhere P is the Performance Index (PI) generated by the process, m Ethanol  is theglucose concentration converted to potential Ethanol, Pethanol  is the Ethanol selling price,mEnzime is the accumulated enzyme mass, Penzyme is the Enzymatic Complex price, Ppower  isthe electric energy price, and PStirring is the power necessary to agitate the reactor.
)=31mBagasse⁻The price for ethanol was 1.50 US$.kg ¹ (FURLAN et al. 2012), the evaluated costof the accumulated enzymatic complex mass was 1.20 US$.kg ¹ (FURLAN et al., 2012)and the electrical power cost was 59.00 US$.Mwh ¹ (DIAS 2011). The solids fraction in thefeeding flow was 0.40. The total times of fed-batch utilized in the optimization were; 360,240, 144, 120, 96 and 48 h and feeding points were realized once an hour. The simulatedreactor initial volume was 10 m³ and throughout the simulations no final reactor volumewas applied. 
⁻⁻A representation of how the optimization works is presented in Figure 7.
During the optimization, a series of restriction may be applied, to generate morefeasible solutions. The profiles were subjected to maximum mass addition and maximumsubstrate concentrations at any given time.
After the optimization reached its stopping criteria, a batch process was simulatedwhere   the  accumulated   bagasse  mass   and   accumulated  enzymatic  complex  from   theoptimum profile were added in the beginning of the process. The batch process revenuewas calculate following the methodology of the fed-batch process. This was performed inorder to evaluate the differences between the batch and fed-batch processes.
32Figure 7 - Feeding profile optimization(Source: author’s collection) 3.6.1. Stirring PowerA vital part of the process PI is the cost of energy in order to agitate the reactor. To
estimate this cost a relation between the solids inside the reactor and the engine torque,and subsequent stirring power. 
In order to achieve this relation, an empirical model was fitted between the stirringpower acquired by monitoring system and the solids inside the reactor. However, solidsconcentration is not available experimentally. Thus, after the most accurate enzymaticvelocity model is chosen, the model is adjusted to each batch experiment following themethodology presented in item 3.5. The balance of the solids output was used in the fittingof the empirical solids/stirring power model.
3.6.2. Hydrolysis Reactor Plant EquivalenceAt the end of each optimization cycle, when the optimum profile was achieved, anextrapolation was performed to determine the reactor size necessary to operate a secondgeneration ethanol production plant.
⁻The fictitious plant operated alongside a standard ethanol plant, milling 500 t.h ¹ of33⁻sugarcane. This generates, approximately, 132 t.h ¹ of bagasse, 20% of this bagasse wasassumed to be used to produce second generation ethanol. Thus, the 2G plant must beable to process 26.4 tbagasse.h ¹. To estimate the necessary reactor volume, or the volumesum of parallel reactors, the total processed bagasse was divided by the reactor finalvolume and process total time. This calculation is shown in Equation 32.
⁻tbagasseh⋅m³m Accumulated BagasseH .C .(
)=Equation 32t f⋅V fWhere H.C. is the hydrolysis capacity of the process, mAccumulated Bagasse is the totalaccumulated bagasse throughout the process,  tf  is the process total time and  Vf  is theprocess volume at the final time.
  This   value   was   then   multiplied   by   the   necessary   productivity   (26.4   tbagasse.h ¹)⁻resulting in the volume necessary to process at this rate.
3.7. NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE OPTIMIZATIONNeural Network (NN) models were used to translate the data from dynamometerand   conductivity/capacitive   probe   to   glucose   concentration.   The   NN   models   wereimplemented in software Matlab 2012 using the Neural Network Toolbox. 
The NN inputs were originated in the data provided by the instrumentation and thereactor state during the high volume batch and fed-batch hydrolysis and were: stirringpower   per   reactor   litter,   conductivity,   capacitance,   accumulated   substrate   feeding   andreactor   volume;   and   the   network   output   was   the   glucose   concentration   from   thechromatography analysis. However, there were too few glucose experimental data pointsto train the NN correctly. To improve the network inference, the best kinetic model wasadjusted for each experiment and the model predicted values were used in the networkoptimization.
Cross validation approach was used to avoid overfitting issues (NELLES, 2001).
The sample universe was first randomized. The samples were then divided in 5 sets. To
evaluate an architecture 4 sets were used while training the network (the current traininggroup) and the unused set was used to validate (the validation group) the current training.
This approach was repeated until all the sets were used as validation set. The average ofthe standard error of training and the average of the standard error of validation were usedto evaluate the architecture performance. A graphical representation of this procedure is34presented in Figure 8.
Figure 8 – Cross Validation Procedure(Source: author’s collection) The architectures taken into account were multilayer perceptrons with one hiddenlayer, the numbers of neurons in the hidden layer were 1, through  15. And the evaluatedtransfer functions for the hidden layer and the sum layer are displayed in Figure 9. Eachtransfer function was evaluated both for the hidden layer and the sum layer. 
A possible NN optimum architecture is achieved when the average standard errorfrom   the   validation   departs   from   the   linear   tendency   of   accompanying   the   averagestandard error from the training. When this happens, a possible interpretation is that thecomplexity of the networks has become larger than the necessary for the system. Thenetworks starts to contemplate, in the pattern recognition, the noise from the samplesdisrupting the network inference (overfitting). 
Therefore,   the   optimum   architecture   is   when   the   errors   are   closely   related(NELLES, 2001). An example of the behavior is presented in Figure 10. In the presentedexample, the point in which the validation error departs from the training error is at around12 neurons in the hidden layer, thus demonstrating to be the optimum architecture for thishypothetical network.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4.1. CONDUCTIVITY MONITORINGThe experiments conducted in the 500 mL vessel provided the data presented inFigure 11.
Figure 11 -  Conductance and glucose concentration during hydrolysis. 
(Source: author’s collection) (Where: Error bars are s.d. of triplicate measurements.)
A linear negative correlation between conductance and glucose concentration in themedium supernatant was observed (see Figure 10 B), slope of -31.82, intercepting point of70.51 and determination coefficient of 0.91. Thus, conductance may be a feasible option tofollow real-time hydrolysis kinetics within the reactor. This motivates further studies usingCCS to monitor the process.
Thus   the   conductance/capacitance   probe   was   installed   in   the   3   L   reactor   tocontinue the studies.
4.2. FULL ARRAY INSTRUMENTATIONWith the full array of sensors properly placed in the reactor, two experiments wereconducted   for   each   hydrolysis   policy.   The   instrumentation   data   for   agitation   power,capacitance and conductance during the batch experiments are presented in Figure 12.
Figure 13 presents the same instrumentation data for the fed-batch experiments.
37Figure 12 - Full Array Monitoring During Batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) Figure 13 - Full Array Monitoring During Fed-batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) The capacitance/conductance probe and dynamometer were able to monitor theexperiments throughout the process. However,  the analytical line and supernatant UV/VISscanning did not show a level of robustness necessary for the application.
The   analytical   line   monitoring   system   initially   was   able   to   sample   the   reactivemedia, dilute the samples and communicate with the spectrophotometer. However, duringlong term experiments, the line had problems both in the software and hardware. At first, aproblem occurred with the serial connections and analysis scheduling. After the solution ofsuch problems, during the experiment the decrease in size of suspended solids particles38generated a cake on the filter membrane, which introduced a pressure drop that the usedpump was not able to overcome, disabling the analytical line. Nevertheless, examples ofsample scans in time periods where the analytical line was operating are presented inFigure 14, for the batch experiments.
Figure 14 – Supernatant Scans During Batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) The data curves overlapping hinders a better analysis, thus Figure 15 presents anamplification of the range between 220 and 400 nm.
Figure 15 – Supernatant Scans from 250 to 320 nm(Source: author’s collection) A peak is present around the region of 283 nm. This peak may be correlated with39the amount of lignin in the solution, since the same region is used in order to estimate thiscompound concentration in lignocellulosic materials (NREL, 2008; GOUVEIA et al., 2009;KLINE   et   al.,   2010).  Another   important   characteristic   of   the   data-set   is   that   the   peakintensity  rises  with  time. This  may  demonstrate  that  lignin  is  being  released  from  thelignocellulosic matrix. Since lignin is a interferent in the process, biding irreversibly to theenzymatic complex (ARANTES & SADDLER, 2011), this instrumentation may be used inorder   to   re-parametrize   the   enzymatic   velocity   model   during   the   process,   in   order   toassess the necessity of addition of enzymatic complex. 
The  robustness  of  this instrumentation  setup  was not  reliable  during the  wholeprocess,   and   the   data   generated   from   this   analytical   line   was   not   used   any   further.
Nonetheless this system may generate important data for the controller software. Thus,further studies will contemplate improvements in the analytical line in order to adequate itto the process.
4.3. BATCH AND FED-BATCH EXPERIMENTAL DATAThe measurements, generated from the HPLC, for the experiments conducted inthe 5 L reactor, are presented in Figure 16 for the batch runs and Figure 17 for the fed-batch policy.
Figure 16 – Experimental Data for Batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) 40Figure 17 – Experimental Data for Fed-batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) Since the concentrations of xylose and cellobiose are small, instead of fitting kineticmodels for the production of these carbohydrates, the experimental data were used toadjust   a   pseudo-stoichiometric   ratio   between   glucose   and   the   xylose   and   cellobioseconcentrations. Glucose concentration and the concentrations of xylose and cellobiose atthe same time were correlated, as it can be seen in Figure 18, for the batch experiments,and in Figure 19, for the fed-batch experiments.
Figure 18 – Batch Experiments Co-products Linear Fitting(Source: author’s collection) 41Figure 19 – Batch Experiments Co-products Linear Fitting(Source: author’s collection) The parameters for each linear fitting is presented in Table 6.

This is the reason for obtaining different slopes in thecorrelations for batch and fed-batch operation. 
However, since the focus of this work is on implementing and testing automationalgorithms, and taking into account that the linear correlations adhered very well to theexperimental data, this simplification was adopted – implying that only one kinetic modelhad to be fitted, describing the formation of glucose. 
4.4. PARAMETERS FITTING  The   models   presented   in   Item   2.4.1.   were   adjusted   to   the   experimental   data42presented in Item 4.3. The models and experimental data are presented in Figure 20 forthe batch experiments and Figure 21 for the fed-batch experiments.

The analysis of the Figures and Table show that the models containing productinhibition were able to fit the data in a satisfactory manner. The models without product43inhibition did not present an adequate adherence. However, a lack of fitting is observed inthe final stages of the hydrolysis, especially for the long term batch policies. This suggeststhat another inhibition phenomenon is occurring within the process.
To improve modeling at the final stages of the hydrolysis it is necessary to evaluateother causes for inhibition or deactivation, such as thermal denaturation, or the addition ofother compounds into the balance that may interfere in the system dynamics.

(Source: author’s collection) (Where: Blue dots are data points inside the 95% confidence region and red dot optimum parameters)The confidence interval topology indicates, once again, that the parameters arehighly correlated, and so it is expected that the current state of the reactor will haveimportant effect on the results of the online re-parametrization of the model. This behaviorfurther demonstrates the necessity of software for online re-parametrization of the model,in order to predict the kinetics of the reaction more accurately. 
 Carvalho et al. (2013) fitted the same kinetic models, but their substrate was steamexploded delignified (4% NaOH) bagasse, and the enzyme was Accellerase 1500®. Theirexperiments were carried out with 6.54% of solids (w.w ¹), 5.7 FPU.g
-1 and inbatch runs only. The modified MM model with product inhibition was also the most suitablekinetic   model,   and   their   adjusted   parameters   were:   k:   0.0033±7.10⁻⁴  min ¹,   Km:±0.87   g.L ¹.   Furthermore,   a   high   correlation   among   the22.06±10.28  g.L ¹,   Ki:   7.61
⁻Pretreated Bagasse⁻⁻⁻45parameters was also found. A nonlinear confidence region with a topology very similar tothe one obtained here was observed as well. 
Although this model is based on very important simplifications of the problem, thecomparison   between   the   two   optimized   sets   of   parameters   may   suggest   someconjectures: Carvalho et al. (2013) used Accelerase 1500®, thus a lower value for K and ahigher value for Km (when compared to the ones obtained in this work, using Cellic Ctec2®) is not an unexpected result, since Cellic Ctec 2® is a more recent commercial cocktail.
On the other hand, a higher Ki value in Carvalho et al. (2013) may be attributed to theirbagasse preteatment, capable of diminishing lignin content (that provided a substrate withonly 5.37 % w.w ¹ of lignin, while in this work the lignin content was approximately 25%w.w. ¹).⁻
⁻The modified Michaelis-Menten model with product inhibition, with the optimizedparameters, was used in the following items to predict values at times not contemplated byexperimental analysis or to predict variables where experimental data were not available.
4.5. STIRRING POWER/SOLIDS RELATIONWith the predicted values from the adjusted models to the experimental batch policydata, the solids concentration and stirring power scatter is presented in Figure 23.
Figure 23 – Stirring Power/Solids Concentration Scatter Plot(Source: author’s collection) ⁻The figure presents two behaviors, with a threshold around 97 g.L ¹. Therefore, thefitting of only one empirical model to the entire range of concentrations may not generate46the necessary adherence. Thus, the profile was divided into two regions, one before andone after the 97 g.L ¹ solids marker. Both regions were subjected to an exponential fitting,the Figure 24, and Figure 25.
⁻⁻Figure 24 – Solids Above 97 g.L ¹ Region Exponential Fitting(Source: author’s collection) ⁻Figure 25 – Solids Bellow 97 g.L ¹ Region Exponential Fitting(Source: author’s collection) The adjusted models are presented in Table 9. 
The analysis of both the figures and table presents that the fitting of the region withhigher solids concentration is more accurate. However, this fitting improvement is achievedsince the data is this region is more sparse and with less inherent noise.
Nevertheless, the models were employed in order to predict the power necessary to47agitate a vessel in a given solids concentration.

However, further studies must contemplate the utilizationof more appropriate models, as well as include further assays to elucidate the relationamong agitation power, solids concentration and reactor volume.

The analysis of Table 10 demonstrates that all fed-batch situations generated apositive PI at the end of the process, while their equivalent batch counterparts, did not.
This is related to the fact that an equivalent batch would with a very high solids (bagasse)concentration,   generating   a   high   agitation   cost.   During   the   fed-batch   process,   theoptimization tool naturally converges to smaller solids concentrations, to reduce energynecessities bellow the threshold between the two agitation power models, where electricity48cost  is  lower. This behavior  is  presented  in  Figure  26,  that  shows  the profiles  of  thecompounds in the reactor, as well as the accumulated feedings.
Figure 26 – Fed-batch Optimization for 360 h Process(Source: author’s collection) To   maintain   solids   concentration   at   low   values,   a   large   volume   of   reactor,   orreactors, is necessary to process the stream of bagasse described in Item 3.6.2, especiallyin long term processes, when the amount of bagasse added to the reactor increasesconsiderably.
The simulations show that there is a clear trade-off between PI and the final productconcentration.   This   occurs   because   longer   processes   enables  a   longer   interactionbetween substrate and enzyme, decreasing solids concentration, and allowing more solidsto be added. Since the addition of solids also dilutes the reactor, more enzyme is added in49order to sustain the reaction velocity. All this generates a higher productivity, with a higherproduct final concentration.
However, more solids generates the necessity for more enzymatic complex, makingthe process more expensive. This is also true for the agitation power. As the process timeincreases so does the energy necessary to agitate the vessel. This however is not true forthe   48h   process,   where   the   PI   and   product   concentration   are   lower   than   the   otherprocesses. This is explained by the fact that in a process as short as the 48h there is notenough time to convert the substrate into product, generating a costly process and withsmall product concentration.
This   tradeoff   is   important   since   a   possible   alternative   in   the   utilization   of   thehydrolyzed lignocellulosic biomass is stream integration (MACRELLI et al., 2012). This isthe   process   of   combining   the   sugar   rich   currents   from   the   sugarcane   mill   and   thehydrolysis reactor product. However, both streams must have similar concentrations, sothat one will not dilute the other. Since the sugarcane juice carbohydrate concentration isaround 180 g.L ¹ (FURLAN et al., 2013), the hydrolyzed liquor must be concentratedthrough evaporation if glucose end concentrations are too far from this target. Evaporatingthe hydrolysis product increases the cost of the process (notice that this cost was notconsidered in the PI defined here). Thus, the PI of the 48h process may be diminished. On
the   other   hand,   the   longer   (and   with   smaller   PI)   process   may   need   less   energy   toconcentrate the liquor, possibly generating a more attractive situation.
⁻It   should   be   stressed   that   the   approach   used   here   for   defining   PI   isolates   thereactor from the rest of the process. The resulting solutions may actually be sub-optimal,but   an   algorithm   for   online   optimal   control   most   certainly   will   be   working   within   thisapproach,   when   dealing   with   real   case   industrial   applications.   Of   course,   someconcatenation with a plant-wide optimization is desirable. One way to improve the linkbetween local and global optimization is improving the calculation of PI. For instance,energy costs for concentration of the reactor effluent may be correlated to the contents ofglucose in this stream. These ideas will be left as a suggestion for future work.
Nevertheless, in the presented simulations, the amount of enzymatic complex usedin the process is not feasible for a large scale process. Enzyme mass in relation to thesubstrate   reaches   values   that   would   rule   out   this   process,   since   a   plant   capable   ofproducing such amount of enzymatic complex would be unfeasible. The batch processes,performed   in   this   work,   used   in   the   composition   of   the   velocity   models   used   1050FPU.gBagasse, and the optimizations reached values 30 times higher than this. This may berelated to the fact that the optimizer needs a small concentration of solids in order toachieve favorable PI situations. Thus, a large amount of enzyme is added in order todecrease solids rapidly. 
To diminish this effect, the same optimization sequence was repeated. But now the cost ofenergy   to   agitate   the   reactor   was   not   taken   into   consideration   when   calculating   theprocess PI. The new simulation summary is presented in Table 11.

Disregarding the agitation power generated higher PI processes, since a part ofcost was not accounted for, as well as diminished the necessity of enzymatic complex foreach bagasse mass unit. This is because without the solids concentration limitation thesubstrate   concentration   does   not   need   to   be   decreased   as   rapidly   as   in   the   lastoptimizations set to decrement agitation power. Therefore, less enzymatic complex needsto be added throughout the process. Higher solids concentration also generates higherend product concentration, even in short term operations. 
Not having a cost limitation correlated with the solids concentrations also reducesthe need for large operating volumes.
However, since there are no limitations on the stirring energy, solids concentrationis let free to reach unfeasible regions. The profile presented in Figure 27 exemplifies thiscondition.
In   this   set   of   simulations   solids   concentration   reached   values   higher   than   30%w.v ¹. For the  reactor design  used  in this  work  this is not  a feasible  situation.  Solidsdeposition occurs at concentrations close to the agitation models threshold (97 g.L-1).
⁻51Figure 27 – Fed-batch Optimization for 360 h Process Without Stirring Power(Source: author’s collection) To overcome the solids concentration and enzyme loading problems, a final set ofsimulations were conducted. In these, the agitation power was accounted for in the samemanner as in the first set of simulations. However, at this time a restriction on the enzymeaddition was applied: the total accumulated enzyme could not surpass 50 FPU.gBagasse ¹.⁻
This represents 5 times the amount used in the experiments assays and was considered afeasible value for large scale processes. 
A summary of the optimizations is presented in Table 12.

enzyme addition to an operational level. This is demonstrated in Figure 28.
Figure 28 – Fed-batch Optimization for 360 h Process With Feeding Restriction53(Source: author’s collection) The plant operational conditions for these simulations were similar to those withoutenzyme restriction, since the same behavior of maintaining low solids concentration wasobserved. The enzyme restriction would not greatly alter the reactor design, particularlywhen dealing with long term processes.
However, in these situations the final product concentration was lower than in theother data sets, especially in the short term operations. This is because the lower enzymeaddition requires more time to hydrolyze the substrate. This solution would then requiremore energy for evaporation of the reactor outlet stream. In order to adequate this processto the 1G-2G carbohydrates stream combination either a longer operation is necessary orthe final hydrolysis product must be concentrated.
Another   possible   solution   is   achieving   higher   solids   concentrations   withoutexpanding   a   large   amount   of   energy   with   agitation.   To   do   that   the   reactor   must   beredesigned to work with higher solids concentrations. 
One design option is the utilization of a Continuous Tubular Screw Reactor (CTSR).
This reactor uses a pressurized screw in order to move the bagasse from one end of thetube to the other. Meanwhile the solids are in contact with the enzymatic complex andhydrolysis occurs with lower energy consumption (TOMÁS et al., 1997). 
The utilization of an alternative reactor design would promote a pre-hydrolysis at asolid consistency where the standard stirred tank would not be operational. After this firstpre-hydrolysis, the more liquefied substrate can be directed to a standard reactor to finishthe hydrolysis.
4.7. NEURAL NETWORK CALIBRATIONThe values generated by the optimized model were used to train an artificial neuralnetwork   to   predict   glucose   concentration   within   the   reactor.   The   input   data   wereconductance, capacitance, agitation power, accumulated solids and reactor volume. Thenetwork errors for each network architecture are presented in Figure 29 and 30. 
54Figure 29 – Artificial Neural Network Errors – Poslin and Logsig Architectures(Source: author’s collection) 55Figure 30 – Artificial Neural Network Errors – Poslin and Logsig Architectures(Source: author’s collection) 56The   majority   of   architectures   presented,   disregarding   certain   deviations,   thebehavior   shown   in   Figure   9,   except   for   the   architectures   containing   a   Pure   Linearactivation function in the hidden layer. The lowest average validation error occurred whenthe architecture contained a Tangent Sigmoid transfer function both in the hidden and sumlayers, and with 11 neurons in the hidden layer. The addition of further neurons to thisarchitecture generates an increase in the validation error, demonstrating that the optimumamount of neurons already occurred.
A  scatter   plot   of   the   simulated   glucose   values   and   the   ones   predicted   by   thenetwork is presented in Figure 31.
Figure 31 – Optimum Architecture Predicted Values(Source: author’s collection) This figure demonstrates a linear relationship between the input values and theones predicted by the ANN. The determination angular coefficient of the data is 0.994,demonstrating a strong correlation among the predicted and input values.
⁻However, at high concentrations (larger than 12 g.L ¹) the dispersion becomes lessstable. This may be explained by the fact that at these concentrations only batch data areavailable This interferes in the prediction in two ways. First, less data are available in the57region, since the fed-batch experiments did not reached these concentrations of product.
Second, these data are gathered at the final hours of the batch process, when the modelused to generate the data becomes less adequate to describe the process, generating adeviation between the available data and the actual data.
Nevertheless, the network demonstrated to be a promising tool in order to estimatethe state of the reactor online, doing so regardless of the policy used in the reactor (batchor fed-batch). This network, or a variation of it, may be used in order to estimate thereaction kinetics in real time, and thus, generate feedback information to the controllersoftware, enabling a closed-loop control strategy.
585. CONCLUSIONSThe first conclusion of this work is that the presented models were able to describethe hydrolysis to some extent. The best model was a Modified Michaelis-Mentem withproduct inhibition. A departure between the experimental and predicted values arises inlong term operations. This may be due to inhibition effects not described by the model.
Thus, further inhibition studies need to be conducted so that the model may be moreaccurate.
The ANN,  after  the architecture optimization, was capable of predicting  productconcentration from available data with a strong correlation (Determination Coefficient of0.972). Therefore, the softsensor can be tested in further studies to generate feedback ofdata to the dynamic control software, in a closed loop architecture.
The optimization software was able to generate profiles that increased the processperformance   index   while   maintaining   operational   levels   within   the   reactor,   reachingglucose concentrations close to those utilized in current first generation technology evenwhen a restriction to enzyme feed was applied (156.0 g.L ¹ of glucose after 360h) or not(168.3 g.L ¹). However, using a stirred tank, fed-batch reactor in the industrial case woulddemand a, relatively, large plant (reactors ranging from 490 to 35,000 m³). Thus, reactordesign must improved in order to adequate this technology to industrial use.
⁻⁻596. FURTHER STUDIES SUGGESTIONSFurther study suggestions include:- Performing experiments to evaluate enzymatic complex inhibition during the hydrolysis.
-   Performing   validation   experiments   with   feeding   strategies   generated   by   the   feedingoptimizer.
- Improve the optical analysis line robustness.
- Further studies with CSS in order to monitor the hydrolysis process.
- Generating a more complete model that correlates solids concentration with agitationpower.
- Optimizing the ANN further, while using other tools in order to estimate reaction kineticsmore accurately.
- Coupling a CTSR to the standard reactor to diminish the overall cost of the process.

-                                                   ivABSTRACTThe continuous demand growth for liquid fuels, alongside with the decrease of  fossil oilreserves, unavoidable in the long term, induces investigations for new energy sources. A
possible alternative is the use of bioethanol, produced by renewable resources such assugarcane   bagasse.   Two   thirds   of   the   cultivated   sugarcane   biomass   are   sugarcanebagasse and leaves, not fermentable when the current, first-generation (1G) process isused. A great interest has been given to techniques capable of utilizing the carbohydratesfrom   this   material.  Among   them,   production   of   second   generation   (2G)   ethanol   is   apossible alternative. 2G ethanol requires two additional operations: a pretreatment and ahydrolysis   stage.   Regarding   the   hydrolysis,   the   dominant   technical   solution   has   beenbased on the use of enzymatic complexes to hydrolyze the lignocellulosic substrate. To
ensure   the   feasibility   of   the   process,   a   high   final   concentration   of   glucose   after   theenzymatic hydrolysis is desirable. To achieve this objective, a high solid consistency in thereactor is necessary. However, a high load of solids generates a series of operationaldifficulties within the reactor. This is a crucial bottleneck of the 2G process. A possiblesolution is using a fed-batch process, with feeding profiles of enzymes and substrate thatenhance   the   process   yield   and   productivity.   The   main   objective   of   this   work   was   toimplement and test a system to infer online concentrations of fermentable carbohydrates inthe reactive system,  and to optimize the feeding strategy of substrate and/or enzymaticcomplex, according to a model-based control strategy. Batch and fed-batch experimentswere conducted in order to test the adherence of four simplified kinetic models. The modelwith best adherence to the experimental data (a modified Michaelis-Menten model withinhibition   by   the   product)   was   used   to   train   an  Artificial   Neural   Network   (ANN)   as   asoftsensor to predict glucose concentrations. Further, this ANN may be used in a closed-loop control strategy. A feeding profile optimizer was implemented, based on the optimalcontrol approach. The ANN was capable of inferring the product concentration from theavailable data with good adherence (Determination Coefficient of 0.972). The optimizationalgorithm generated profiles that increased a process performance index while maintainingoperational   levels   within   the   reactor,   reaching   glucose   concentrations   close   to   thoseutilized in current first generation technology a (ranging between 156.0 g.L ¹ and 168.3
g.L ¹).   However   rough   estimates   for   scaling   up   the   reactor   to   industrial   dimensionsindicate that this conventional reactor design must be replaced by a two-stage reactor, tominimize the volume of liquid to be stirred.

⁻⁻vRESUMOA crescente demanda por combustíveis líquidos, bem como a diminuição das reservas depetróleo, inevitáveis a longo prazo, induzem pesquisas por novas fontes de energia. Umapossível solução é o uso do bioetanol, produzido de resíduos, como o bagaço de cana-de-açúcar. Dois terços da biomassa cultivada são bagaço e folhas. Estas frações não sãofermentescíveis quando se usa a tecnologia de primeira geração atual (1G). Técnicascapazes de utilizar os carboidratos deste material vem sendo estudas, a fim de aumentara   rentabilidade   da   cadeia   produtiva.   Dentre   elas,   a   produção   de   etanol   de   segundageração (2G) é uma possível alternativa.  Etanol 2G requer duas operações adicionais:etapas de pré-tratamento e hidrólise. Considerando a hidrólise, a técnica dominante temsido a utilização de complexos enzimáticos para hidrolisar o substrato lignocelulósico.
Para   assegurar   a   viabilidade   do   processo,   uma   alta   concentração   final   de   glicose   énecessária ao final do processo.  Para atingir esse objetivo, uma alta concentração desólidos no reator é necessária. No entanto, uma carga grande de sólidos gera uma sériede dificuldades operacionais para o processo. Este é um gargalo crucial do processo 2G.
Uma   possível   solução   é   utilizar   um   processo   de   batelada   alimentada,   com   perfis   dealimentação de enzima e substrato para aumentar produtividade e rendimento. O principalobjetivo deste trabalho é implementar e testar um sistema para inferir concentração decarboidratos   fermentescíveis   automaticamente   e   otimizar   a   política   de   substrato   e/ouenzima em tempo real, de acordo com uma estratégia de controle baseada em modelocinético. Experimentos de batelada e batelada alimentada foram realizados a fim de testara aderência de 4 modelos cinéticos simplificados. O modelo com melhor aderência aosdados   experimentais   (um   modelo   de   Michaelis-Menten   modificado   com   inibição   porproduto) foi utilizado para gerar dados a fim de treinar uma rede neural artificial parapredizer concentrações de glicose automaticamente. Em estudos futuros, esta rede podeser utilizada para compor o fechamento da malha de controle. Um otimizador de perfil dealimentação foi implementado, baseado em uma abordagem de controle ótimo. A redeneural foi capaz de predizer a concentração de produto com os dados disponíveis demaneira satisfatória (Coeficiente de Determinação de 0.972).  O algoritmo de otimizaçãogerou   perfis   que   aumentaram   o   desempenho   do   processo   enquanto   manteve   ascondições da hidrólise dentro de níveis operacionais, e gerou concentrações de glicosepróximas as obtidas pelo caldo de cana-de-açúcar da primeira geração (valores entre156.0 g.L ¹ e 168.3 g.L ¹). No entanto, estimativas iniciais de aumento de escala doprocesso   demonstraram   que   para   atingir   dimensões   industriais   o   projeto   do   reatorutilizado deve ser analisado, substituindo o mesmo por um processo em dois estágiospara diminuir o volume do reator e energia para agitação.

xiii1. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVESThe  continuous  demand  growth  for  liquid  fuels,   alongside  with  the  decrease  offossil oil reserves, unavoidable in the long term, induces investigations for new energysources. A possible solution to substitute some liquid fossil fuels is the use of bioethanol,produced from renewable sources (NAIK et al., 2010).
In Brazil, a massive production of ethanol as automotive fuel occurred in the 1970s,when the government initiated a national program (Pró-Álcool) to reduce the dependencyon foreign refined oil. The Pró-Álcool program had as main starting material sugarcanejuice. This culture was intensified during this period, especially in southeast Brazil. Thetechnology used in the program, called first generation (1G), was similar to the one utilizednowadays.   But   two   thirds   of   the   cultivated   biomass,   i.e.   sugarcane   bagasse   or   otherlignocellulosic materials such as leaves, generates non fermentable substrates when thecurrent process is applied (FREITAS & KANEKO, 2012).
Even though the biomass is non fermentable via 1G processes may be used togenerate other forms of energy (bioelectricity, production of syngas and so on), there isgreat interest in developing techniques capable of converting the carbohydrates from thismaterial into bioethanol, thus generating more ethanol from each sugarcane mass unit(DANTAS et al., 2013).
Currently, large-scale 2G ethanol production still presents economic bottlenecks.
Among the most important technical hindrances is the scale up of the hydrolysis processto industrial application, in order to generate high product yields while keeping costs low(MODENBACH & NOKES, 2013).
This work intended to test and implement a softsensor architecture using ArtificialNeural   Networks,   to   predict   the   concentration   of   sugars   in   a   bioreactor   during   theenzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated sugarcane bagasse using cellulases from a commercialcocktail.   Besides,   an   algorithm   based   on   optimal   control   theory   was   implemented,   todefine feeding strategies of substrate and/or enzymatic complex for the hydrolysis reactor.
It should be stressed that the main goal of this work is not to propose an optimaloperational policy for a specific bioreactor, but rather to establish a consistent methodologyto be applied in industrial plants. Besides, the experimental data that were used to fitmodels and to tune softsensors, and although the methodology may be consistent, the1final results hardly could be applied, directly, to industry-scale reactors. 
Nevertheless, the algorithms to be described here, using computational intelligencetools and applying advanced dynamic control theory, are expected, with modifications, tobe useful for further use in the biorefinery, thus contributing for the consolidation of the 2Gindustrial process.
22. LITERATURE REVIEW2.1. LIGNOCELLULOSIC COMPOUNDSSecond   generation   biofuels   are   fuels   produced   from   lignocellulosic   substrates.
These   are   fibers   found   in   plants   and   vegetables.   Their   main   function   is   to   providestructural support, while assuring microbiological and chemical protection. The fractions oflignocellulosic materials are mostly composed by cellulose (32–55%), hemicellulose (19–24%), lignin (23–32%) and ashes (3–6%) (SANTOS et al., 2012). 
Cellulose, (C6H1005)n,  is the most abundant polysaccharide in the fiber. Its orderedstructure consists of several hundred glucose molecules (XU et al., 2013). The cellulosespatial conformation is determined by three main interactions. The first interaction is theglycosidic   bond   that   unites   a   glucose   to   another   glucose   molecule   through   acovalent bond. This generates cellobiose, and this disaccharide is repeated throughout thepolymer   chain   (ROCHA   et   al.,   2011).   The   second   interaction   is   among   hydrogenmolecules from the same chain and the third between adjacent chains. Due to theseinteractions, part of cellulose macromolecules can form a crystalline region, granting to theentire structure a high cohesiveness, and rendering it insoluble in water and several othersolvents, and resistant to hydrolysis (SANTOS et al., 2012).
Hemicellulose   differs   significantly   from   cellulose.   It   is   a   heteropolysaccharidecomposed by hexoses (glucose, galactose and mannose), pentoses (xylose, the mostabundant   monomer,   and   arabinose),   acetic   acid,   glucuronic   acid   and   4-O-methy-glucuronic   acid.   The   relation   between   these   substances   differs   from   vegetable   tovegetable. This portion of the  tissue does not  form  crystalline regions, thus  it can  beremoved or hydrolyzed more easily than cellulose (CANILHA et al., 2012).
Lignin is formed by the polymerization of p-coumaryl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol andconiferyl alcohol. It is the second most abundant polymerer in the lignocellulosic biomass,and provides a barrier against foreign agents. Recalcitrance of the biomass is in great partdue to this lignin barrier (ARANTES & SADDLER, 2011). In order to prevent this effect, adelignification procedure may be applied. From a biorefinery point of view, the recuperatedlignin may be used in other processes (STEWART, 2008). Alternatively, its combustion willprovide an extra heat source to the 2G process.
To   produce   ethanol   from   these   lignocellulosic   materials   the   structural3polysaccharides must be hydrolyzed, so that their monosaccharides (mostly pentoses andhexoses)   become   available   to   fermentative   microorganisms.   However,   before   thehydrolysis   process,   a   pretreatment   is   required   to   separate   and   render   cellulose   andhemicellulose available to the hydrolytic action of the enzyme cocktail. A representation ofthe process is in Figure 1.
Figure 1 – Lignocellulosic Biomass Processing (Source: author’s collection, adapted from: SANTOS et al., 2012)2.2. BIOMASS PRETREATMENTThe   pretreatment   procedure   destabilizes   the   lignocellulosic   structure,   making   itmore   susceptible   to   further   processing.   This   is   achieved   by   increasing   the   materialporosity, reducing cellulose crystallinity and removing lignin, to a certain degree. The entireprocedure must be applied up to an intensity that generates an optimum platform forsubsequent operations, while considering the formation of inhibitors and cost effectiveness(CHIARAMONTI et al, 2012). 
Several methodologies are available for this process. Thus, the choice of the mostadequate pretreatment depends on the feedstock, process plant design and economicsituation (BANERJEE et al., 2010).
Among several available pretreatments, in this work special attention will be givento autohydrolysis,  also  know  as hydrothermal pretreatment. This procedure  requires a4pressurized reactor to maintain water in a liquid state at temperatures ranging from 150ºCto   230ºC,   for   different   time   periods.  At   these   temperatures,   biomass   suffers   cooking,increasing cellulose digestibility, while producing small amounts of inhibitors (KIM et al.,
2009). 
Another   advantage   of   this   technology   is   the   absence   of   additional   chemicalcompounds   during   the   process,   yielding   a   less   toxic   effluent   than   other   alternatives.
However,   this   pretreatment   does   not   alters   lignin   to   an   extent   that   may   render   thesemolecules   inactive   in   subsequent   processes   (MENON   &   RAO,   2012).   A   typicalcomposition of sugarcane bagasse, for the most significant compounds, before and afterthe autohydrolysis process is presented in Table 1.

(Source: Adapted from RODRIGUEZ-ZÚÑIGA et al., 2014)2.3. LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS HYDROLYSISThe   pretreated   biomass   must   be   further   hydrolyzed   to   provide   fermentablefractions. At this stage, the polymers released by the pretreatment are converted to freemonomers, readily available to fermentation.  Two mains technologies are used in order tohydrolyze lignocellulosic materials, using acid solution, generally sulfuric acid, or usingenzymatic complexes (GAMAGE et al., 2010; SUN & CHENG, 2002). 
Acid   hydrolysis   is   usually   divided   in  two   groups,   diluted   and   concentrated   acidhydrolysis. In diluted acid hydrolysis, acid concentrations range from 1 to 3% w.w -1, at hightemperatures, 200–240ºC. Due to the high temperature toxic compounds and inhibitors,such   as   furfurals   and   hydroxymethylfurfural,   are   generated   after   the   degradation   ofpentoses and hexoses . This degradation does not only decreases the hydrolysis finalyield, but the generated compounds are toxic to further production stages, such as thefermentation process (LIMAYEM & RICKE, 2012). 
5Concentrated acid is a more common process methodology. In this operation theacid concentration is high and, therefore, temperatures can be lower. Thus, this processgenerates   a   smaller   amount   of   inhibitors.   However,   the   utilization   of   such   high   acidconcentrations is costly, and also generates a highly toxic effluent (SUN & CHENG, 2002).
This leads to the necessity for a more economically and environmental suitableprocess.   One   alternative   is   enzymatic   hydrolysis.   This   sort   of   procedure   yields   highconversions, with fewer risks of producing toxic secondary products (LIMAYEM & RICKE,2012). However, a high cost is inherent to this process, since, the compound itself has ahigh value and, with the current technology, direct enzymatic complex reuse is not feasiblewhen using a soluble enzymatic complex (DANTAS et al., 2013).
To   introduce   enzymatic   hydrolysis   into   the   ethanol   production   route   severalresearch routes are explored, among them: enzymatic complex improvement (KUPSKI etal.,   2013);   implementations   of   the   second   generation   technology   alongside   the   firstgeneration   process   (FURLAN   et   al.,   2012);   utilizing   high   substrate   loading;   hydrolysisoptimization modifying the feeding policy to the reactor in a fed-batch process (HODGE etal., 2009; CAVALCANTI-MONTAÑO et al., 2013).
2.3.1. Modeling Enzymatic Lignocellulosic Biomass HydrolysisTo   optimize   the   bioreactor   design   and   operational   conditions   it   is   necessary   tounderstand the kinetics that commands the interaction of the lignocellulosic material andthe enzymatic complex. This study is difficult since several effects are reported amongsubstrate and catalyst (SOUSA JR et al., 2011). To cope with such complexity, a largenumber of models are proposed to elucidate this process behavior.
Different   approaches   are   used   to   model   the   process.  A  summary   of   them   ispresented in Table 2.
Analysis of Table 2 indicates that the model choice must be based on the goal to beachieved. As the model's phenomenological foundation increases, so does its complexity,generating the necessity for more specific data. However, for some reactive systems itmay be unpractical—or even unfeasible—to measure all significant effects, necessary tovalidate more complex models. For a macro analysis of an industrial process, these detailsmay not even be significant at all. Thus an adequate tradeoff between available data andmodel complexity must be sought.

Models   of   this   category   reflect   some—at   least   rough—understanding   of   thephenomena   occurring   in   the   system,   though   only   using   relative   simple   data,   such   asproduct concentration throughout time, for model fitting and validation. This class of modelis generally applied for optimization and designing industrial reactors (CARVALHO et al.,
2013). 
The most popular semi-mechanistic models for enzymatic reactions  are derivationsof Michaelis-Menten’s (Michaelis & Menten, 1913). However, Michaelis-Menten model isbased on mass action laws valid for substrates (and products) in the fluid (liquid, in thiscase) phase. This is not true for the specific case of lignocellulosic hydrolysis, since mostof the substrate is solid. The excess substrate to enzyme condition ([S]>>[E]), necessaryto the quasi-steady state condition, is also never achieved, since the fraction of celluloseavailable to hydrolysis is not high enough. This derives from the fact that hydrolysis occursin a heterogeneous medium, and the reaction is occurring on the substrate surface, so theenzyme must first diffuse to the reactive site to be able to act (BANSAL et al., 2009). 
7Nevertheless, literature has shown that Michaelis-Menten models may be suitableto fit experimental results of the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials, despite the lack ofphysical-chemical background. Yet, in order to use this type of model some assumptionregarding the substrate solid state must be established. Two options are available in theliterature: using a pseudo-homogenous assumption for the solid substrate (Equation 1). Or
using a modified form of the model, which assumes that the soluble enzyme attacks thesolid substrate, but with negligible changes of the substrate initial concentration (Equation2);   the   soluble   enzyme   has   to   absorb   (and   desorb)   from   the   solid   substrate.   Theconcentration   of   enzyme   absorbed   on   the   substrate   must   be   much   smaller   than   theamount free in the medium ([E]>>[Eads])  (CARVALHO et al., 2013).
v= k⋅[ E]⋅[S]( K m+[S])               Equation 1v= k⋅[ E]⋅[S]( K m+[E])Where,   v   is the reaction rate,   k   is the enzyme turnover number,   [ E]   is theenzyme concentration,   [S]   is the substrate concentration and   K m   is the Michaelis-Menten half-saturation constant. 
Equation 2Both models are showed to be able of fitting hydrolysis data. However, they do notaccount   for   inhibitors   present   in   the   process.   Bezerra   &   Dias   (2004)   showed   that   apseudo-homogenous   model   with   competitive   inhibition   by   the   product   was   the   mostsuitable model in this case, as other effects that may reduce hydrolysis rates, such asnonproductive cellulase binding, enzyme jamming and enzyme deactivation were not sosignificant,   according   to   these   authors.   Following   this   approach,   Equation   1   can   bemodified into Equation 3.
k⋅[ E]⋅[S]K m⋅(1+ [ P]K icv=              Equation 3)+[S]Where   K ic   is the competitive inhibition constant. Even though this is a rathersimplified model, it is expected from the literature results that this structure may hold forthe conditions that will be studied in this work. 
8The same consideration of competitive inhibition can be applied to Equation 2, togenerate a modified Michaelis-Menten model with product inhibition. 
k⋅[ E]⋅[S]K m⋅(1+[ P]K icv=              Equation 4)+[ E]2.3.2. Enzymatic ComplexDue to the high complexity of the lignocellulosic material, the enzymatic catalystused for biomass hydrolysis is not composed by only one active protein, but by a congressof several molecules, each interacting with a portion of the substrate.
The   enzymes   that   interact   with   cellulose   to   produce   glucose   are   denominatedcellulases. Cellulases are enzymatic complexes that may be produced by fermentation offilamentous   fungi   from   the   genre  Trichoderma,  Aspergillus   and   Penicillum  (WYMAN,2003). 
Cellulases   are   divided   in   three   main   groups.   Endoglucanases   (endo-1,4-β-glucanase) work in the amorphous region of the cellulose molecule and binds randomly,liberating reductive ends in the chain. Celobiohydrolases (exo-1,4-β-glucanase) act in thereducing   and   non-reducing   ends   of   the   chain,   both   e   natural   ones,   and   on   the   onesgenerated by Endoglucanases. The last group is composed by  β-glucosidases and itsfunction   is   to   hydrolyze   cellobiose   into   glucose   (THONGEKKAEW   et   al,   2008).   Otherenzymes may be used as addictives to enhance the performance of the cocktail. Oxidasessuch as lytic polysaccharides monooxygenases are one example (HORN et al., 2012).
Residual hemicellulose, that was preserved in the solid substrate after the pre-treatment of the biomass, can be hydrolyzed by the action of a group of enzymes know as α-L-Hemicellulases.
arabinofuranosidase, among others (JORGENSEN et al., 2007).
 β-xylanes   and  endoxylanases,them   are:  Among  All these enzymes are commonly found in commercial cocktails, although the exactcomposition of such complexes is not disclosed.
2.4. HIGH SOLIDS ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSISThe   so   called   C6   liquor,   essentially   glucose   for   further   fermentation   (withSaccharomyces cerevisiae), is the output of the enzymatic bioreactor, where cellulose9hydrolysis occurs. For the economics of the overall processes, it is very important thatglucose   is   yielded   at   high   concentrations,   thus   reducing   the   amount   of   water   in   thesolution. Ideally, for sugar cane mills, the target should be minimizing the energy demandby   reaching   glucose   concentrations   as   close   as   possible   to   the   sugarcane   juice’s,aproximally 180 g.L ¹ (FERNANDES, 2003). Either if the C6 liquor is used in separatefermenters or if it is mixed with the sugarcane juice, a concentrated C6 liquor will reducethe demand of heating power in the global process (DIAS et al., 2012; FURLAN et al.,
2012).
⁻Thus, a high solid consistency (load of substrate within the reactor) is necessary,generating   a   more   concentrated   carbohydrate   solution   at   the   end   of   the   process.  Aspreviously mentioned, a more concentrated final product would enable the addition of the2G stream to the 1G’s, before the fermentation (HUMBIRD et al., 2010), without (or withminimal) demand of evaporators after the hydrolysis reactor. High-solids loadings alsogenerate economical advantages since the operational volume will be lower than with low-solids operation, resulting in less energy to heat or cool the reactor. Disposal treatmentcosts would be lower too, due to the reduction of water usage (HODGE et al., 2009).
High solids processes are those where the ratio of solid material to aqueous phaseis such that very little free liquid is present (HODGE et al.,   2009). As water becomessparse within the reactor two main issues arise. Water is first and foremost necessary inorder to provide a medium in which the chemical reaction will take place. At high solidscontent, mass transfer becomes an issue, since the enzyme will be hindered to reachingits reactive site (MODENBACH & NOKES, 2013).
The   second   issue   is   the   reactive   medium   apparent   viscosity.   Water   dilutes   thesolids   inside   the   reactor,   effectively   decreasing   viscosity,   and   increasing   the   lubricitybetween the particles. A larger lubricity decreases the required shear rate to agitate thereactor. A smaller agitation necessity leads to smaller power consumption. Therefore, athigh solids rates, reactor mixing becomes an issue, due to the high power demanded(KRISTENSEN et al., 2009). Thus, it would be interesting to have a reactor operationalpolicy that would bypass such conditions.
2.5. BIOMASS HYDROLYSIS IN SEMI-CONTINUOUS OPERATIONSBiomass hydrolysis in fed-batch processes appears as a promising strategy sinceadverse conditions of a standard batch are avoided. A process policy where substrate is10fed into the reactor continuously avoids the necessity of beginning the process with highsolid loadings, facilitating the system homogenization. Furthermore, in fed-batch process,when compared to the same process done in a standard batch process, the conversionand   productivity   is   higher,   since   smaller   solid   loadings   diminish   inhibitions,   especiallyenzyme/substrate inhibitions (HODGE et al., 2009).
Studies for the optimization of fed-batch processes may begin by promoting batchhydrolyses under high-solids concentrations, when stirring and mixing in the tank maybecome   a   problem   (HODGE   et   al.,   2008).  After   the   reactor   model   is   consolidated,alterations are made in order to contemplate the feeding flow (HODGE et al., 2009). 
Most of the published studies deal with spreading the initial substrate load evenlyduring  the batch time,  and do not propose optimum  profiles (CHANDRA  et  al.,  2011;GUPTA et al., 2012). This implementation does not optimize the system, and may notmaximize its performance. Optimal control theory (dynamic optimization) may be appliedto maximize productivity and minimize the utilization of enzymatic complex (CAVALCANTI-MONTAÑO et al., 2013).  A   summary   of   previous   literature   results   in   the   subject   ispresented in Table 3.
Table 3 brings important points to the discussion. The work of Chandra et al. (2011)is the only presented research that does not demonstrate an improvement with the fed-batch system when compared with a standard batch. This work also is the only one thatdoes not alters enzyme complex concentration  throughout the process, indicating thatthere   can   be   a   relation   between   the   enzyme   feeding   profile   and   fed-batch/batchimprovement .
Another important characteristic is that none of the cited works considers the powerdemands   for   stirring   within   the   reactor.   The   papers   do   not   consider   how   the   solidsconcentration will influence the reactor operation cost, and when the solid concentration isconsidered, the value is related to the reactor operational range, and not related to someindex indicating the performance of the process. Nevertheless, as it will be shown further,it   is   imperative   to   consider   the   agitation   power,   and   how   it   is   changed   by   solidsconcentration, for the optimization of the process.

OPTIMAL CONTROLThe optimal control problem (or dynamic optimization) consists in, basically, findingcontrol variables  optimum  profiles (several decisions dynamics), control parameters orproject   variables   values   (static   variables)   and   possibly   the   process   final   time   thatmaximizes   (or   minimize)   a   performance   scalar   (objective   function   or   cost   function)(RIBEIRO & GIORDANO, 2005; RAMIREZ, 2004). The direct formulation of the optimalcontrol problem is as follows (SRINIVASAN et al., 2003):min(u(t ), p , t )J (u , p)=ψ(x(t f ), p ,t f )Equation 5Subjected to:˙x=f ( x(t),u(t), p, t)                x(t 0)=x0Equation 612g( x (t), u(t ), p ,t )=0S(x (t),u(t), p)≤0             T ( x(t f))≤x0Equation 7Equation 8By   minimizing,   or   maximizing,   the   functional,   or   cost   function,   J   under   theconstraints and weights given by the other equations an optimum profile for the controlvariable may be calculated (RAMIREZ, 2004).
Where J is the functional, or cost function,  x(t)  is the state variables vector, andx0  is the, usually known initial conditions,  u(t )  is the control variable profile throughouttime,  g  is the equality constraint vector,  S  is the inequality constraint vector and  p  arestatic decision variables.
There are several methods to calculate the optimum solution. The solution methodvaries with how the state and input variables are handled, and how the numerical solutionis   carried   out.   The   functional   presented   in   Equation   5   may   be   optimized   in   a   directapproach, by  using an  optimization algorithm,  or indirect approach,  by using methodsbased in variational calculus such as the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and the principleof optimality of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SRINIVASAN et al., 2003). 
A simple method for solving the optimal control problem stated (Equations 5–8) isthe   sequential   approach.   In   contrast   to   indirect   approaches,   in   this   direct   method   noanalytical differentiation  is needed and  it is an adjoint-free  computation,  i.e. no  adjoinvariables (Lagrange multipliers) has to be calculate. In this method however, the controlvector,  u(t) must be parameterized using a finite set of parameters—the actual decisionvariables. Though this method is easy to implement, it tends to be slow, especially wheninequality path constraints are included in the problem. (SRINIVASAN et al., 2003).
2.7. ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS FED-BATCH OPTIMAL CONTROL It should be stressed that the definition of the functional, or cost function, is a keystep to have a well-posed optimal control problem. Defining reasonable criteria to evaluatethe “optimality” of a specific solution in real life is probably the most challenging task forthe process engineer that is implementing optimal control algorithms. 
In the special case of lignocellulosic hydrolysis, some possible performance indexesare:   productivity   per   enzyme   mass,   fermentable   carbohydrates   conversion,   finalcarbohydrates concentration, some economical index related with the operational cost of13the bioreactor with the selling price of bioethanol. The dynamic control variables may bethe mass inflow of substrate and of enzymatic complex.
Most optimal control techniques presented in the literature for biomass hydrolysisare open loop, no method for information feedback is used. That is, the optimal policiesare previously computed, assuming that the real process will not deviate greatly from themodel predictions. Thus, disturbances originated from several sources, such as substratecomposition variations or errors in secondary control systems, are not corrected by thecontrol software (UPETRI, 2013). To consider these variations it is necessary to close thecontrol loop, enabling the automatic update of control profiles based on the current stateand future possibilities.
The   feedback   of   data   gives   the   control   layer   capabilities   for   dealing   withuncertainties,   not   considered   in   the   internal   models.   Previously   determined   kineticparameters   may   then   be   re-estimated,   and   optimum   trajectories   of   the   system,recalculated. The feedback may generate a better performance when comparing to openoptimization. However, a closed-loop control mesh may render the system more sensitiveto external variations. This comes from the fact that, to maintain the system optimized, thecontroller   distributes   the   error   into   the   controlled   values   by   intensifying   activationsdensities. This effect generates a stress in the component, since more activations arenecessary (NAGY & BRAATZ, 2004).
Commonly, the update of optimal profiles for fed-batch processes is translated intochanges   in   the   feeding   streams   to   the   reactor.   This   is   especially   the   case   whentemperature is not an adequate variable to be manipulated, following profiles that changewith time: certainly, this is not a desirable strategy for an enzymatic reactor, since thecatalytic action of the enzymes is restrict to narrow ranges of temperature. Essentially, thiskind of reactor will be operated isothermally, in a temperature where the enzyme activity ishigh, while thermal inactivation is not significant. Although, this approach may be improved(considering thermal profiles during operation of the reactor), in this work the reactor willbe isothermal (the temperature closed loop feedback control runs in standalone feature,with a fixed set point).
Besides   temperature,   other   secondary   variables   may   be   manipulated   by   thedynamic control algorithm. One example is  the agitation. 
142.8. ONLINE FERMENTABLE CARBOHYDRATES DETERMINATIONIn the hydrolysis of the cellulose fraction of the biomass, the desired products arefree   carbohydrates,   especially   glucose.   Therefore,   to   optimize   this   compound   finalconcentration, a methodology capable of predicting concentrations of this substance onlineis necessary. Several methods can be applied to quantify them, ranging from titration andcolorimetric techniques to chromatographic analysis (SLUITER et al., 2010).
Nevertheless, these techniques are used in laboratory scale, demanding qualifiedoperators and a relatively long time (DEMARTINI et al., 2011). Therefore, usual analyticaltechniques are not suitable to online monitoring, and more suitable methods must bedeveloped, able to be used within an automated supervision/control framework.
A possible alternative to monitor fermentable carbohydrates is the utilization of softsensing to infer the state of the system. In a softsensor, a set of measurements, obtainedfrom different sensors, are the input for a model (usually empirical, black box) whoseoutput is the inference of the variable of interest. Although extrapolation is not expected tobe accurate with this kind of model, the accuracy and precision of the predictions musthold when a set of input values is not contained in the original experimental data (but iswithin the range of the data used for tuning the softsensor). Among the most popular softsensing algorithms are: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) combined with  Least PartialSquare   (LPS)   regression;  Artificial   Neural   Networks   (ANN);   and   Neuro-Fuzzy   systems(NF) (KADLEC et al., 2009). 
Artificial   Neural   Networks   (ANNs)   are   mathematical   models   inspired   by   themechanism that the human brain uses to handle information. One important application ofANNs   is   patter   recognition.  Among   several   types   of  ANN   architectures,   the   multilayerperceptrons   (MLP)   can   be   highlighted.   In   this   architecture   each   artificial   neuron   isconnected to all the neurons in the following layer, the input for each neuron is multipliedby   a   weight   value   and   then   it   is   introduced   into   a   transfer   function.   The   networkcomposition is carried by a training stage using an optimization method to minimize theerror between the model output and the experimental value, using independent test datasets (not applied in the tuning of the ANN parameters) to avoid overfitting. After training,the network may be applied to predict the value of the monitored variable from the primary,directly measurable, variables (DEHURI & CHO, 2009). 
152.8.1. Torque MeasurementTorque   is   an   important   variable   when   analyzing   the   rheometry   of   a  solution   orsuspension. Usually, torque measurement is done off-line: a sample of the medium isloaded in a bench rheometer (EHRHARDT et al., 2010). 
In studies that monitor rheometry throughout the enzymatic hydrolysis process, aclear decrease in the torque demanded to agitate the medium is observed when the solidsin the reactor are hydrolyzed (SAMANIUK et al., 2011) However, these authors did notmeasure the torque online. Using a system capable of monitoring the torque throughoutthe process may enable solids monitoring, and this measured data can be used in the softsensor.
2.8.2. Visible and Ultraviolet SpectroscopyAn analytical online system, capable of analyzing the supernatant optical properties,alongside the hydrolysis reactor, can uncover new behaviors of the hydrolysis kinetics.
Specially the presence of inhibitors of the enzyme complex within the reactor may bedetected. 
This  idea  is  supported  by the  fact  that  lignin absorbs  electromagnetic  radiationstrongly in the ultraviolet region. Some methodologies use this characteristic in order toascertain lignin contents in the biomass (NREL, 2008; GOUVEIA et al., 2009; KLINE et al.,
2010).
Thus, an instrumentation capable of measuring lignin, as well as other possibleanalytes, can be feedback into the controller unit in order to generate the input of the softsensor, and provide information (including inhibitors concentrations) to re-parametrize thekinetic model used by the optimal control algorithm.
2.8.3. Conductance/Capacitance SpectroscopyConductance and Capacitance Spectroscopy (CCS) is based on the generation ofalternating electrical fields in the media (inside the reactor, in our case). Thus, the CCSsensor   is   an  in   situ  measuring   device.   Under   certain   frequencies,   some   groups   ofmolecules are polarized. This polarization changes the dielectric constant of the medium.
This can be measured as variations in the conductance, the capacity of the medium toallow   an   electrical   current   to   pass   through   itself,   and   capacitance,   the   capacity   of   amedium to store electrical charge (VOJINOVIC et al., 2006).
16CCS   has   been   recently   reported   for   monitoring   the   hydrolysis   of   lignocellulosicmaterial by Bryant et al., 2013 who observed a linear correlation between capacitance thecontents of solids inside the reactor.
Therefore,   an   instrument   of   this   sort  can   be  used  to  aid  the   monitoring  of   thereactor, either as a standalone instrument or as a source of input signals to the soft sensorlayer.
173. MATERIALS AND METHODS3.1. ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSISBagasse was donated by Usina Ipiranga S/A (Descalvado, SP) in July 16th  2014,and it is the product of milling sugar cane used to extract the high carbohydrate contentjuice from this vegetable. The bagasse was then dried, to a humidity   close to 5%, andfreezed at – 7 ºC. 
Batch and fed-batch enzymatic hydrolysis were performed utilizing hydrothermallypretreated sugar cane bagasse. The pretreatment was carried out in pressurized reactor,with a maximum pressure of 13 Bar, at 200 RPM. The reactor was loaded with 0.10 gramsof dry bagasse per milliliter of reactor (10 % w.v ¹⁻ ) and then programmed to reach 195 ºCand hold this temperature for 10 min. The pretreated bagasse was then dried in kiln for24h at 60 ºC. This methodology was predetermined with the research group.
⁻The batch experiments were realized using 10 % w.v ¹ of dry pretreated bagassesuspended in 4.80 pH and 50 mM citrate buffer and 50 ºC (WANG  et al., 2012).  Thehydrolysis was carried out in stirred vessel containing 3 L of reactive media in a 5 Lcontainer. The reactor was stirred at 470 RPM by a pair of Elephant Ear impellers, bothequally distributed between the vessel bottom and the liquid surface. Temperature insidethe reactor was maintained using a thermostatic water bath set to 50 ºC. The total batchtime was 48 h and manual analysis were performed at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 12.0,
24.0, 36.0 and 48.0 h. 
The enzymatic complex used was Cellic Ctec 2®  donated by Novozymes LatinAmerica (Araucária, PR). In the batch experiments, 1.04 g (13.84 mL) were added, thismass is equivalent to a loading of   10 FPU.g Bagasse ¹, which is the operational load instudies within the research group. Filter Paper Unity (FPU) is the unit used in order tomeasure cellulase hydrolysis potential.
⁻The fed-batch experiments were performed with similar conditions to those of batchexperiments, 4.80 pH and 50 mM citrate buffer and 50ºC. However, the substrate and  theenzymatic complex were not added in the beggining of the process, but, however, fed tothe reactor following a feeding profile, presented in Table 4. The experiments lasted for 6h.
The substrate feeding was carried out with a solids concentration of 40% in the inlet flow.
The reactor initial volume was 3 L and was filled until 3.5 L. 
18Two experiments were performed for each strategy. Manual samples were taken 2minutes before and 2 minutes after each feeding instant.

3.2. MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEMThis   work   proposes   the   dimensioning   and   construction   of   a   system   capable   ofmonitoring,   translating   the   data   from   a   sensor   array   into   a   product   concentrationprediction, evaluating the reaction state and optimizing further activations to maximize theprocess efficiency. A schematic of how the system works is presented in Figure 2. 
Further explanations on how the systems interact are contained in the followingitems.
19Figure 2 - Monitoring and control system(Source: author’s collection) 3.3. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS The reactor where the hydrolysis happens possesses an instrumentation array withthe purpose of monitoring the free glucose concentration inside the reactive media at anygiven time during the hydrolysis process. The sensors measurements are relayed to aserver that decodes the information, converts to the interest variable unit of measurementwhen necessary and stores the data. 
Figure 3 presents a scheme of the system sensors.
20Figure 3 - Sensor array coupling(Source: author’s collection) 3.3.1. Torque Measurement The torque measurement was achieved using digital dynamometer coupled to thestirring shaft. The electric motor was above a ball bearing mount, thus the engine was freeto roll in its own axle. By coupling a dynamometer perpendicularly to a rod fixated in theball bearing a force was measured. This force is proportional to the amount of energynecessary to agitate the reactive media. To convert the straight force into stirring power,Equation 9 was used.
P=T⋅ωEquation 9Where   P,   is   the   power   necessary   for   the   stirring   motion,   T   is   the   torquemeasurement itself and ω is the axle angular velocity. Torque may be substituted by the21variables in Equation 10.
T=F⋅LEquation 10Where  F  is   the   force  provided   by  the   dynamometer  and   L  the  distance  of   thedynamometer   coupling   to   the   center   of   the   agitation   axle.   Further   modifications   areprovided by Equation 11.
ω=2⋅π⋅NEquation 11Where N is the rotation frequency, results in a simplification to convert the forcemeasured by the dynamometer into stirring power presented in Equation 12.
P=2⋅π⋅F⋅L⋅NEquation 12This instrument relays data through a serial connection to a server under a RS-232protocol. The server receives this information through a universal serial bus (USB) portand handles the data in a software layer inside a Python console. This measurement wasmade at 20 seconds of the batch.
3.3.2. Supernatant Sampling and ScanThe supernatant optical properties was measured by an analytical line once anhour. The supernatant sampling begins with the filtration of the reactive media by a pumicestone filter. The driving force for the filtration was provided by a peristaltic pump. Part ofthe   filtrated   supernatant,   0.2   mL,   was   destined   to   a   dilution   vessel.  The   dilution   wasaccomplished   by   a   series   of   valves   and   a   peristaltic   pump.   The   dilution   line   workediteratively, adding 4.0 mL per iteration, and the sample dilution necessity was assessed bythe last scan, updating itself automatically. 
After the dilution, the prepared sample was injected into a flow cuvette inside thespectrophotometer. With the sample properly contained, 20 scans ranging from 190 to1100 nm was performed. This range comprehends the ultra violet and visible region of theelectromagnetic spectrum. The data generated by the scans were transmitted to the serverby a serial connection, under a RS-232 protocol, and the server received the informationthrough a USB port and decoded by a software layer operating in a Python console.
At the end of the scans, dilution water was injected into the cuvette to clean it. Afterthe cleaning period, only water was added to the cuvette and 5 scans were performed toestablish a baseline for the next series of scans.
22The automation of sampling system was accomplished by a physical computationaldevice for data acquisition called Arduino. The Arduino board is an open hardware platformcapable of generating electronic outputs or reading inputs in a standalone method or as aslave   for   a   server   (BANZI,   2009).   The   signals   to   change   the   controller   states   aregenerated by a software layer coded and run in a Python console.
3.3.3. Conductivity and Capacitance MeasurementThe conductivity and capacitance measurements was performed by a single probeconnected to a preamplifier and transmission module Fogale Nanobiotech. The frequencyused was 382 kHz.
3.3.4. Enzymatic Hydrolysis Monitoring Through ConductivitySmall-scale studies were carried out to assess how the conductivity changes insidethe hydrolysis media and evaluate this methodology as a tool to monitor hydrolysis insidethe reactor before adding this instrumentation a larger reactor. Three small-scale batchexperiments were conducted in a 500 mL reactor, with conditions similar to the large-scaleexperiments. Citrate buffer at 4.80 pH and 50 mM, 10% w.v ¹ dry bagasse, 50 ºC andadding 0.17 g of enzymatic complex.   In these experiments, the probe relayed its datathrough a serial RS-232 connection and the decoding was achieved by the proprietarysoftware (FOGALE NANOTECH BIOMASS+ v 1.0). 
⁻In the larger scales, the rest of the instrumentation was applied, however whenusing the capacitance/conductivity system inside the 3L reactor the acquired data by thisprobe was relayed to the server through  a 4 to 20 mA connection. The signal was read bythe data acquisition module Arduino Mega through two analog input ports, and then thedata was relayed to the server via serial RS-232 connection. 
3.4. CARBOHYDRATES DETERMINATIONGlucose determination was carried out manually at the offline sampling periodsdescribed   in   the   Item   3.1.   The   analysis   itself   was   performed   via   glucoseoxidase/peroxidase enzymatic determination kit (Doles; Goiânia, GO, Brazil) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  (HPLC). 
The samples were withdrawn from the reactor by filling a 2 mL vessel with reactivemedia. The container was centrifuged for 7 min at 10,000 RPM. 0.5 mL of the supernatantwas combined with 0.1 mL of sodium hydroxide 0.2 N to maintain storage preservation.
23HPLC was used to determinate glucose, xylose and cellobiose concentrations. Thesamples   were   analyzed   in   Shimadzu   SCL-10A  chromatograph   using   refraction   indexdetector RID10-A, Animex HPX-87H Bio-rad, using as mobile phase sulfuric acid 5 mM ata flow of 0.6 mL.min ¹. The samples were compared to previously established standards(NREL, 2008).
⁻Enzymatic   kit   analysis   was   used   to   check   HPLC   glucose   concentration.   Theanalysis occurred by combining 10 μmL of the prepared sample and 1 mL of the enzymaticanalysis complex, incubating the mixture at 37ºC for 5 min and measuring the absorbanceat 510 nm. The measured absorbance was compared to a standard curve of glucosedetermined with the kit in the same manner that the sample is analyzed. All analyses wereperformed in triplicates. 
3.5. COMPOUNDS BALANCE AND MODEL FITTINGIn order to estimate parameters and optimize feeding strategies, a global massbalance for the reactor and each compound was developed.
Given that the reactor is presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4 – Reactor Schematics and Inflows(Source: Author's collection)For the the presented schematics, the global mass balance is as follows:dmdt= ˙mIEquation 14˙mI   is the mass inflow (g.min ¹) of both substrate (solids) and enzymatic⁻Where  complex. 
24The measurement of volumes and densities of the humid bagasse substrate is notstraightforward.   The   substrate   is   a   slurry   of   pretreated   bagasse   and   water.   Here,   toemulate the substrate feed in an industrial process, the substrate was dried and citratebuffer (50 mM, pH 4.8) was  added, in quantitative amounts (masses).
The reaction medium consists of solids (that will be liquefied) dispersed in a liquidphase. As a first approximation, the variation of density of the liquid in the reaction medium(due to the liquefaction of the solid substrate into soluble products) was neglected. In otherwords, the density of the liquid medium was assumed constant, and equal to the water(the density of the enzymatic complex was also assumed equal to water's). In order tosimplify the model, we assume as control volume only the liquid phase inside the reactor.
Of course, these hypotheses can be refined, using empirical correlations for the apparentdensities, but this approach will be left as a suggestion for the continuation of the presentwork. Thus the global mass balance becomes:F SF EdVdt= ˙V=+Equation 15[E]Inflow[S]InflowWhere FS is the mass inflow of dry substrate (in g.min ¹), ⁻[S]Inflow is the mass of drysolids divided by the water in the inflow (with 40 % of solids in the inflow feed stream,[S]Inflow becomes 666 gDry Solids.LWater ¹), ⁻[E]Inflowis the concentration of total protein in the enzymatic complex in the inflow stream (in g.L ¹,⁻FE is the mass inflow of enzyme (in g.min ¹), ⁻˙V  (L.min ¹) is the volumetric reactor inflow⁻⁻the used value was 75.71 g.L ¹), and .
The substrate mass balance is presented in equation 3.
dSdt=F S−REquation 16Where S is the solid substrate mass in the reactor, R is the rate of disappearance of⁻substrate   (gSubstrate.min ¹).   The   balance   can   be   described   in   terms   of   substrateconcentration as follows.
d (V⋅[S])=F S⋅SG−S−v .V
Equation 17dt⁻Where V is the reactor volume (L), v is the reaction volumetric rate (in g.L ¹.min ¹),[S]  is  the  substrate  concentration  in  terms  of  potential glucose  (g.L ¹),  and   SG­S  is  a⁻⁻25⁻pseudo-stoichiometric ratio (cellulose content in the solids, 0.55 w.w ¹, multiplied by thehydrolysis stoichiometric ratio between glucose and cellulose, 1.10 wglucose.wcellulose ¹). Thisequation can be further modified:⁻+V⋅d[ S]dt[S]⋅dVdtSubstituting the global mass balance (Equation 2), Equation 5 becomes:=F S⋅SS−G−v.V
Equation 18FS⋅SS−G−v−[ S]⋅ ˙VVd [S]dt=Equation 19VThe product mass balance follows:dPdt=+REquation 20Where P is the product mass inside the reactor. The balance can be described interms of product concentration:d (V⋅[ P])=+v⋅VEquation 21dtWhere  [P]  is the product concentration inside the reactor (g.L ¹). Substituting the⁻global mass balance (Equation 2), and modifying it, the product balance becomes:=+v− [P]⋅ ˙VVd⋅[ P]Equation 22dtThe enzyme mass balance follows:d (V⋅[ E])=F EEquation 23dtWhere  [E]  is the enzyme concentration inside the reactor (g.L ¹). This equation,⁻after modifications and using the global mass balance as:F EV−[ E]⋅ ˙VVd [E ]dt=Equation 24The   mass   balance   for   the   solids   suspended   in   the   reactor   must   consider   theproduction of coproducts (xylose and cellobiose), besides glucose:26d (V⋅[Sol ])=FS−V⋅[v( 1SG−C+Xyl+Cell)]Equation 25dtWhere  [Sol]  is the solids concentration inside the reactor,  SG-C  is the hydrolysisstoichiometric   ratio   between   glucose   and   cellulose,   1.10   wglucose.wcellulose ¹,  ⁻Xyl  is   thepseudo-stoichiometric,   empirical   ratio   between   the   rates   of   formation   of   xylose   andglucose   and  Cell  is   the   pseudo-stoichiometric,   empirical   ratio   between   the   rates   offormation   of   cellobiose   and   glucose.   With   further   modification,   the   solids   balancebecomes:FSV+v⋅Xyl+v⋅Cell−[S]⋅ ˙VVd⋅[ Sol]− vSG−C=Equation 26dtEquations 15, 19, 22, 24 and 26 are the equations used in the following items asthe compounds balance.
The   stoichiometric   rates   were   adjusted   with   the   data   provided   by   thechromatographic analysis. The xylose and cellobiose concentrations are estimated from alinear fitting of these compounds and the glucose concentration. This procedure is carriedseparately for the batch and fed-batch experiments.
To avoid inconsistencies in the numerical solving of the model, the feeding profilecannot be a discrete vector with punctual in certain time instants. Therefore, the vectorwas interpolated to a continuous function throughout the time domain. A representation ofthis interpolation is presented in Figure 5. 
27Figure 5 - Interpolation Example(Source: author’s collection)  (Where: Discrete feedings (kg) at certain time instants wereapproximated to a continuous flow (kg.h ¹))⁻In   the   Fig.   4,   the   blue   circles   represent   the   discrete   values   (optimized   feedingvectors)   and   the   blue   solid   line   represents   the   generated   continuous   function.   Theinterpolation  algorithm  behaved  equally  for  the  bagasse  and  enzymatic complex  inputprofiles.
The numerical method used to integrate the differential system was a Runge-Kutta4th order with variable step. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to fitthe parameters.
PSO minimizes the average quadratic error between the system output and theexperimental   value   (cost   function   chosen)   by   generating   a   series   of   particles.   Theseparticles are scattered in a multidimensional space, with as many dimensions as there areparameters   to   be   optimized,   in   this   case   a   3   dimensions   space.  A  velocity   in   eachdimension is attributed to the particle. Since the dimensions are the parameters to beoptimized, one particle position is tested inside the model to evaluate its fitting. If the newfitting is better (smaller error) than a previous one found by the same particle (PersonalBest) the new position is attributed as a new best particular position. The fitting value is28also compared to a Global Best, which is the best value and position achieved by anyparticle.  After   the   comparison   stage,   the   particles   velocities   are   updated   to   make   theparticles converge to the best global and individual fitting. To fully emulate a swarm, thevelocities are also regulated by a Momentum parameter. The Momentum decreases witheach iteration, simulating fatigue within the particles in a moment when they should benear the minimum value (KARIMI et al., 2012). An explanatory pseudocode containing thedescribed numeric procedure is presented in Table 5.

The   social   parameters   (KENEDY   &   EBERHART,   2001)  c1  and  c2responsible   for   the   weighting   in   the   velocities   update   were   set   to   2.00   and   2.10
respectively. The equation that updates the velocity is presented in Equation 27.
vk+1=vk+c1∗rand()∗( pbest−xk)+c2∗rand ()∗(gbest−xk)Equation 27Where, vk  is the particle's velocity, vk+1  is the next position, rand( ) is a random29number between 0 and 1, pbest is the particle's velocity with the best fitting, gbest is theposition that obtained the best fitting among all particle's and xk  is the particle's currentposition. The position update is presented in Equation 28.
xk+1=xk+M⋅vkEquation 28Where, xk+1 is the particle's next position and M the particle's momentum.
The momentum parameter was initially set to 0.99. However, after all the particle'svelocities were updated, this parameter was decreased until it reached a value lower than0.20, after this point the momentum was reinitialized to 0.99, and positions randomizationwere performed. This approach is necessary to relocate the swarm from a possible localminimal point.
After the optimization procedure ends, the confidence interval for each adjustedmodel is calculated. An approximate confidence region can be calculated using Equation29 (HIMMELBLAU, 1970).
2⋅F1−α[m,n−m]C . R .=s ^Y iEquation 292Where  C.R.  is the confidence region range,   s^Y i  is  the  standard error for eachparameter,  F1-α  is   the   upper   limit   of   the   F-distribution,  m  is   the   number   ofparameters and n is the number of experimental data points.
The contour for the sum of squares surface can be calculated accordingto Equation 30.
φ=φmin{1+ m⋅F1−α[m,n−m]}Equation 30(n−m)Where ϕ is the squared error threshold for the region, if a parameters group has asquared error value higher than this value it is considered outside the confidence error andϕmin is the squared error for the optimized parameter (HIMMELBLAU, 1970).
The entire procedure follows the dynamic demonstrated in the Figure 6.
30Figure 6 - Model Fitting Flowchart(Source: author’s collection) 3.6. FED-BATCH OPTIMIZATIONWith the optimized models and its optimized parameters, Equations 15, 19, 22, 24and 26 presented in item 3.5 were used to optimize the feeding strategy. The mass flowwere   subjected   to  an   optimization  method,   where  the   profiles,   both  for  substrate   andenzymatic complex, changed at each iteration until an optimum bagasse and enzymaticcomplex addition is achieved. 
The sequential approach and PSO algorithm, described in the previous item, wereused   to   solve   the   optimal   control   problem.   Therefore,   the  input   flow   had   to   beparameterized. Vectors with equal amount of points for bagasse and enzyme additionwere created. The first value is the initial compound addition, and the other points areadditions throughout the process.
For each evaluated feeding profiles, an integration of the fed-batch product balanceis realized. The performance of the simulated feeding profile was evaluated by convertingthe   final   carbohydrate   concentration   into   potential   ethanol,   via   theoretical   maximumstoichiometric coefficient, and subtracting from the revenue of selling this product the cost31of the enzymatic complex and electrical power necessary to agitate the reactor. This valueis divided by the total mass of bagasse added in the process in order to generate arevenue   related   to   the   added   mass   (US$.kgBagasse ¹).   Hence   the   objective   functionbecomes:⁻t f PStirringmEthanol⋅P Ethanol−mEnzyme⋅PEnzyme−P Power∫t 0EquationPI ( US $kgbagasseWhere P is the Performance Index (PI) generated by the process, m Ethanol  is theglucose concentration converted to potential Ethanol, Pethanol  is the Ethanol selling price,mEnzime is the accumulated enzyme mass, Penzyme is the Enzymatic Complex price, Ppower  isthe electric energy price, and PStirring is the power necessary to agitate the reactor.
)=31mBagasse⁻The price for ethanol was 1.50 US$.kg ¹ (FURLAN et al. 2012), the evaluated costof the accumulated enzymatic complex mass was 1.20 US$.kg ¹ (FURLAN et al., 2012)and the electrical power cost was 59.00 US$.Mwh ¹ (DIAS 2011). The solids fraction in thefeeding flow was 0.40. The total times of fed-batch utilized in the optimization were; 360,240, 144, 120, 96 and 48 h and feeding points were realized once an hour. The simulatedreactor initial volume was 10 m³ and throughout the simulations no final reactor volumewas applied. 
⁻⁻A representation of how the optimization works is presented in Figure 7.
During the optimization, a series of restriction may be applied, to generate morefeasible solutions. The profiles were subjected to maximum mass addition and maximumsubstrate concentrations at any given time.
After the optimization reached its stopping criteria, a batch process was simulatedwhere   the  accumulated   bagasse  mass   and   accumulated  enzymatic  complex  from   theoptimum profile were added in the beginning of the process. The batch process revenuewas calculate following the methodology of the fed-batch process. This was performed inorder to evaluate the differences between the batch and fed-batch processes.
32Figure 7 - Feeding profile optimization(Source: author’s collection) 3.6.1. Stirring PowerA vital part of the process PI is the cost of energy in order to agitate the reactor. To
estimate this cost a relation between the solids inside the reactor and the engine torque,and subsequent stirring power. 
In order to achieve this relation, an empirical model was fitted between the stirringpower acquired by monitoring system and the solids inside the reactor. However, solidsconcentration is not available experimentally. Thus, after the most accurate enzymaticvelocity model is chosen, the model is adjusted to each batch experiment following themethodology presented in item 3.5. The balance of the solids output was used in the fittingof the empirical solids/stirring power model.
3.6.2. Hydrolysis Reactor Plant EquivalenceAt the end of each optimization cycle, when the optimum profile was achieved, anextrapolation was performed to determine the reactor size necessary to operate a secondgeneration ethanol production plant.
⁻The fictitious plant operated alongside a standard ethanol plant, milling 500 t.h ¹ of33⁻sugarcane. This generates, approximately, 132 t.h ¹ of bagasse, 20% of this bagasse wasassumed to be used to produce second generation ethanol. Thus, the 2G plant must beable to process 26.4 tbagasse.h ¹. To estimate the necessary reactor volume, or the volumesum of parallel reactors, the total processed bagasse was divided by the reactor finalvolume and process total time. This calculation is shown in Equation 32.
⁻tbagasseh⋅m³m Accumulated BagasseH .C .(
)=Equation 32t f⋅V fWhere H.C. is the hydrolysis capacity of the process, mAccumulated Bagasse is the totalaccumulated bagasse throughout the process,  tf  is the process total time and  Vf  is theprocess volume at the final time.
  This   value   was   then   multiplied   by   the   necessary   productivity   (26.4   tbagasse.h ¹)⁻resulting in the volume necessary to process at this rate.
3.7. NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE OPTIMIZATIONNeural Network (NN) models were used to translate the data from dynamometerand   conductivity/capacitive   probe   to   glucose   concentration.   The   NN   models   wereimplemented in software Matlab 2012 using the Neural Network Toolbox. 
The NN inputs were originated in the data provided by the instrumentation and thereactor state during the high volume batch and fed-batch hydrolysis and were: stirringpower   per   reactor   litter,   conductivity,   capacitance,   accumulated   substrate   feeding   andreactor   volume;   and   the   network   output   was   the   glucose   concentration   from   thechromatography analysis. However, there were too few glucose experimental data pointsto train the NN correctly. To improve the network inference, the best kinetic model wasadjusted for each experiment and the model predicted values were used in the networkoptimization.
Cross validation approach was used to avoid overfitting issues (NELLES, 2001).
The sample universe was first randomized. The samples were then divided in 5 sets. To
evaluate an architecture 4 sets were used while training the network (the current traininggroup) and the unused set was used to validate (the validation group) the current training.
This approach was repeated until all the sets were used as validation set. The average ofthe standard error of training and the average of the standard error of validation were usedto evaluate the architecture performance. A graphical representation of this procedure is34presented in Figure 8.
Figure 8 – Cross Validation Procedure(Source: author’s collection) The architectures taken into account were multilayer perceptrons with one hiddenlayer, the numbers of neurons in the hidden layer were 1, through  15. And the evaluatedtransfer functions for the hidden layer and the sum layer are displayed in Figure 9. Eachtransfer function was evaluated both for the hidden layer and the sum layer. 
A possible NN optimum architecture is achieved when the average standard errorfrom   the   validation   departs   from   the   linear   tendency   of   accompanying   the   averagestandard error from the training. When this happens, a possible interpretation is that thecomplexity of the networks has become larger than the necessary for the system. Thenetworks starts to contemplate, in the pattern recognition, the noise from the samplesdisrupting the network inference (overfitting). 
Therefore,   the   optimum   architecture   is   when   the   errors   are   closely   related(NELLES, 2001). An example of the behavior is presented in Figure 10. In the presentedexample, the point in which the validation error departs from the training error is at around12 neurons in the hidden layer, thus demonstrating to be the optimum architecture for thishypothetical network.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4.1. CONDUCTIVITY MONITORINGThe experiments conducted in the 500 mL vessel provided the data presented inFigure 11.
Figure 11 -  Conductance and glucose concentration during hydrolysis. 
(Source: author’s collection) (Where: Error bars are s.d. of triplicate measurements.)
A linear negative correlation between conductance and glucose concentration in themedium supernatant was observed (see Figure 10 B), slope of -31.82, intercepting point of70.51 and determination coefficient of 0.91. Thus, conductance may be a feasible option tofollow real-time hydrolysis kinetics within the reactor. This motivates further studies usingCCS to monitor the process.
Thus   the   conductance/capacitance   probe   was   installed   in   the   3   L   reactor   tocontinue the studies.
4.2. FULL ARRAY INSTRUMENTATIONWith the full array of sensors properly placed in the reactor, two experiments wereconducted   for   each   hydrolysis   policy.   The   instrumentation   data   for   agitation   power,capacitance and conductance during the batch experiments are presented in Figure 12.
Figure 13 presents the same instrumentation data for the fed-batch experiments.
37Figure 12 - Full Array Monitoring During Batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) Figure 13 - Full Array Monitoring During Fed-batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) The capacitance/conductance probe and dynamometer were able to monitor theexperiments throughout the process. However,  the analytical line and supernatant UV/VISscanning did not show a level of robustness necessary for the application.
The   analytical   line   monitoring   system   initially   was   able   to   sample   the   reactivemedia, dilute the samples and communicate with the spectrophotometer. However, duringlong term experiments, the line had problems both in the software and hardware. At first, aproblem occurred with the serial connections and analysis scheduling. After the solution ofsuch problems, during the experiment the decrease in size of suspended solids particles38generated a cake on the filter membrane, which introduced a pressure drop that the usedpump was not able to overcome, disabling the analytical line. Nevertheless, examples ofsample scans in time periods where the analytical line was operating are presented inFigure 14, for the batch experiments.
Figure 14 – Supernatant Scans During Batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) The data curves overlapping hinders a better analysis, thus Figure 15 presents anamplification of the range between 220 and 400 nm.
Figure 15 – Supernatant Scans from 250 to 320 nm(Source: author’s collection) A peak is present around the region of 283 nm. This peak may be correlated with39the amount of lignin in the solution, since the same region is used in order to estimate thiscompound concentration in lignocellulosic materials (NREL, 2008; GOUVEIA et al., 2009;KLINE   et   al.,   2010).  Another   important   characteristic   of   the   data-set   is   that   the   peakintensity  rises  with  time. This  may  demonstrate  that  lignin  is  being  released  from  thelignocellulosic matrix. Since lignin is a interferent in the process, biding irreversibly to theenzymatic complex (ARANTES & SADDLER, 2011), this instrumentation may be used inorder   to   re-parametrize   the   enzymatic   velocity   model   during   the   process,   in   order   toassess the necessity of addition of enzymatic complex. 
The  robustness  of  this instrumentation  setup  was not  reliable  during the  wholeprocess,   and   the   data   generated   from   this   analytical   line   was   not   used   any   further.
Nonetheless this system may generate important data for the controller software. Thus,further studies will contemplate improvements in the analytical line in order to adequate itto the process.
4.3. BATCH AND FED-BATCH EXPERIMENTAL DATAThe measurements, generated from the HPLC, for the experiments conducted inthe 5 L reactor, are presented in Figure 16 for the batch runs and Figure 17 for the fed-batch policy.
Figure 16 – Experimental Data for Batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) 40Figure 17 – Experimental Data for Fed-batch Experiments(Source: author’s collection) Since the concentrations of xylose and cellobiose are small, instead of fitting kineticmodels for the production of these carbohydrates, the experimental data were used toadjust   a   pseudo-stoichiometric   ratio   between   glucose   and   the   xylose   and   cellobioseconcentrations. Glucose concentration and the concentrations of xylose and cellobiose atthe same time were correlated, as it can be seen in Figure 18, for the batch experiments,and in Figure 19, for the fed-batch experiments.
Figure 18 – Batch Experiments Co-products Linear Fitting(Source: author’s collection) 41Figure 19 – Batch Experiments Co-products Linear Fitting(Source: author’s collection) The parameters for each linear fitting is presented in Table 6.

This is the reason for obtaining different slopes in thecorrelations for batch and fed-batch operation. 
However, since the focus of this work is on implementing and testing automationalgorithms, and taking into account that the linear correlations adhered very well to theexperimental data, this simplification was adopted – implying that only one kinetic modelhad to be fitted, describing the formation of glucose. 
4.4. PARAMETERS FITTING  The   models   presented   in   Item   2.4.1.   were   adjusted   to   the   experimental   data42presented in Item 4.3. The models and experimental data are presented in Figure 20 forthe batch experiments and Figure 21 for the fed-batch experiments.

The analysis of the Figures and Table show that the models containing productinhibition were able to fit the data in a satisfactory manner. The models without product43inhibition did not present an adequate adherence. However, a lack of fitting is observed inthe final stages of the hydrolysis, especially for the long term batch policies. This suggeststhat another inhibition phenomenon is occurring within the process.
To improve modeling at the final stages of the hydrolysis it is necessary to evaluateother causes for inhibition or deactivation, such as thermal denaturation, or the addition ofother compounds into the balance that may interfere in the system dynamics.

(Source: author’s collection) (Where: Blue dots are data points inside the 95% confidence region and red dot optimum parameters)The confidence interval topology indicates, once again, that the parameters arehighly correlated, and so it is expected that the current state of the reactor will haveimportant effect on the results of the online re-parametrization of the model. This behaviorfurther demonstrates the necessity of software for online re-parametrization of the model,in order to predict the kinetics of the reaction more accurately. 
 Carvalho et al. (2013) fitted the same kinetic models, but their substrate was steamexploded delignified (4% NaOH) bagasse, and the enzyme was Accellerase 1500®. Theirexperiments were carried out with 6.54% of solids (w.w ¹), 5.7 FPU.g

⁻Pretreated Bagasse⁻⁻⁻45parameters was also found. A nonlinear confidence region with a topology very similar tothe one obtained here was observed as well. 
Although this model is based on very important simplifications of the problem, thecomparison   between   the   two   optimized   sets   of   parameters   may   suggest   someconjectures: Carvalho et al. (2013) used Accelerase 1500®, thus a lower value for K and ahigher value for Km (when compared to the ones obtained in this work, using Cellic Ctec2®) is not an unexpected result, since Cellic Ctec 2® is a more recent commercial cocktail.
On the other hand, a higher Ki value in Carvalho et al. (2013) may be attributed to theirbagasse preteatment, capable of diminishing lignin content (that provided a substrate withonly 5.37 % w.w ¹ of lignin, while in this work the lignin content was approximately 25%w.w. ¹).⁻
⁻The modified Michaelis-Menten model with product inhibition, with the optimizedparameters, was used in the following items to predict values at times not contemplated byexperimental analysis or to predict variables where experimental data were not available.
4.5. STIRRING POWER/SOLIDS RELATIONWith the predicted values from the adjusted models to the experimental batch policydata, the solids concentration and stirring power scatter is presented in Figure 23.
Figure 23 – Stirring Power/Solids Concentration Scatter Plot(Source: author’s collection) ⁻The figure presents two behaviors, with a threshold around 97 g.L ¹. Therefore, thefitting of only one empirical model to the entire range of concentrations may not generate46the necessary adherence. Thus, the profile was divided into two regions, one before andone after the 97 g.L ¹ solids marker. Both regions were subjected to an exponential fitting,the Figure 24, and Figure 25.
⁻⁻Figure 24 – Solids Above 97 g.L ¹ Region Exponential Fitting(Source: author’s collection) ⁻Figure 25 – Solids Bellow 97 g.L ¹ Region Exponential Fitting(Source: author’s collection) The adjusted models are presented in Table 9. 
The analysis of both the figures and table presents that the fitting of the region withhigher solids concentration is more accurate. However, this fitting improvement is achievedsince the data is this region is more sparse and with less inherent noise.
Nevertheless, the models were employed in order to predict the power necessary to47agitate a vessel in a given solids concentration.

However, further studies must contemplate the utilizationof more appropriate models, as well as include further assays to elucidate the relationamong agitation power, solids concentration and reactor volume.
4.6. FEEDING PROFILE OPTIMIZATIONThe feeding profile optimization, as describe in Item 3.6. was done using as themodel optimized in Item 4.4 to predict reactions rates, and both models presented in Item4.5 to estimate the energy demand for stirring the vessel.

The analysis of Table 10 demonstrates that all fed-batch situations generated apositive PI at the end of the process, while their equivalent batch counterparts, did not.
This is related to the fact that an equivalent batch would with a very high solids (bagasse)concentration,   generating   a   high   agitation   cost.   During   the   fed-batch   process,   theoptimization tool naturally converges to smaller solids concentrations, to reduce energynecessities bellow the threshold between the two agitation power models, where electricity48cost  is  lower. This behavior  is  presented  in  Figure  26,  that  shows  the profiles  of  thecompounds in the reactor, as well as the accumulated feedings.
Figure 26 – Fed-batch Optimization for 360 h Process(Source: author’s collection) To   maintain   solids   concentration   at   low   values,   a   large   volume   of   reactor,   orreactors, is necessary to process the stream of bagasse described in Item 3.6.2, especiallyin long term processes, when the amount of bagasse added to the reactor increasesconsiderably.
The simulations show that there is a clear trade-off between PI and the final productconcentration.   This   occurs   because   longer   processes   enables  a   longer   interactionbetween substrate and enzyme, decreasing solids concentration, and allowing more solidsto be added. Since the addition of solids also dilutes the reactor, more enzyme is added in49order to sustain the reaction velocity. All this generates a higher productivity, with a higherproduct final concentration.
However, more solids generates the necessity for more enzymatic complex, makingthe process more expensive. This is also true for the agitation power. As the process timeincreases so does the energy necessary to agitate the vessel. This however is not true forthe   48h   process,   where   the   PI   and   product   concentration   are   lower   than   the   otherprocesses. This is explained by the fact that in a process as short as the 48h there is notenough time to convert the substrate into product, generating a costly process and withsmall product concentration.
This   tradeoff   is   important   since   a   possible   alternative   in   the   utilization   of   thehydrolyzed lignocellulosic biomass is stream integration (MACRELLI et al., 2012). This isthe   process   of   combining   the   sugar   rich   currents   from   the   sugarcane   mill   and   thehydrolysis reactor product. However, both streams must have similar concentrations, sothat one will not dilute the other. Since the sugarcane juice carbohydrate concentration isaround 180 g.L ¹ (FURLAN et al., 2013), the hydrolyzed liquor must be concentratedthrough evaporation if glucose end concentrations are too far from this target. Evaporatingthe hydrolysis product increases the cost of the process (notice that this cost was notconsidered in the PI defined here). Thus, the PI of the 48h process may be diminished. On
the   other   hand,   the   longer   (and   with   smaller   PI)   process   may   need   less   energy   toconcentrate the liquor, possibly generating a more attractive situation.
⁻It   should   be   stressed   that   the   approach   used   here   for   defining   PI   isolates   thereactor from the rest of the process. The resulting solutions may actually be sub-optimal,but   an   algorithm   for   online   optimal   control   most   certainly   will   be   working   within   thisapproach,   when   dealing   with   real   case   industrial   applications.   Of   course,   someconcatenation with a plant-wide optimization is desirable. One way to improve the linkbetween local and global optimization is improving the calculation of PI. For instance,energy costs for concentration of the reactor effluent may be correlated to the contents ofglucose in this stream. These ideas will be left as a suggestion for future work.
Nevertheless, in the presented simulations, the amount of enzymatic complex usedin the process is not feasible for a large scale process. Enzyme mass in relation to thesubstrate   reaches   values   that   would   rule   out   this   process,   since   a   plant   capable   ofproducing such amount of enzymatic complex would be unfeasible. The batch processes,performed   in   this   work,   used   in   the   composition   of   the   velocity   models   used   1050FPU.gBagasse, and the optimizations reached values 30 times higher than this. This may berelated to the fact that the optimizer needs a small concentration of solids in order toachieve favorable PI situations. Thus, a large amount of enzyme is added in order todecrease solids rapidly. 
To diminish this effect, the same optimization sequence was repeated. But now the cost ofenergy   to   agitate   the   reactor   was   not   taken   into   consideration   when   calculating   theprocess PI. The new simulation summary is presented in Table 11.

Disregarding the agitation power generated higher PI processes, since a part ofcost was not accounted for, as well as diminished the necessity of enzymatic complex foreach bagasse mass unit. This is because without the solids concentration limitation thesubstrate   concentration   does   not   need   to   be   decreased   as   rapidly   as   in   the   lastoptimizations set to decrement agitation power. Therefore, less enzymatic complex needsto be added throughout the process. Higher solids concentration also generates higherend product concentration, even in short term operations. 
Not having a cost limitation correlated with the solids concentrations also reducesthe need for large operating volumes.
However, since there are no limitations on the stirring energy, solids concentrationis let free to reach unfeasible regions. The profile presented in Figure 27 exemplifies thiscondition.
In   this   set   of   simulations   solids   concentration   reached   values   higher   than   30%w.v ¹. For the  reactor design  used  in this  work  this is not  a feasible  situation.  Solidsdeposition occurs at concentrations close to the agitation models threshold (97 g.L-1).
⁻51Figure 27 – Fed-batch Optimization for 360 h Process Without Stirring Power(Source: author’s collection) To overcome the solids concentration and enzyme loading problems, a final set ofsimulations were conducted. In these, the agitation power was accounted for in the samemanner as in the first set of simulations. However, at this time a restriction on the enzymeaddition was applied: the total accumulated enzyme could not surpass 50 FPU.gBagasse ¹.⁻
This represents 5 times the amount used in the experiments assays and was considered afeasible value for large scale processes. 
A summary of the optimizations is presented in Table 12.

enzyme addition to an operational level. This is demonstrated in Figure 28.
Figure 28 – Fed-batch Optimization for 360 h Process With Feeding Restriction53(Source: author’s collection) The plant operational conditions for these simulations were similar to those withoutenzyme restriction, since the same behavior of maintaining low solids concentration wasobserved. The enzyme restriction would not greatly alter the reactor design, particularlywhen dealing with long term processes.
However, in these situations the final product concentration was lower than in theother data sets, especially in the short term operations. This is because the lower enzymeaddition requires more time to hydrolyze the substrate. This solution would then requiremore energy for evaporation of the reactor outlet stream. In order to adequate this processto the 1G-2G carbohydrates stream combination either a longer operation is necessary orthe final hydrolysis product must be concentrated.
Another   possible   solution   is   achieving   higher   solids   concentrations   withoutexpanding   a   large   amount   of   energy   with   agitation.   To   do   that   the   reactor   must   beredesigned to work with higher solids concentrations. 
One design option is the utilization of a Continuous Tubular Screw Reactor (CTSR).
This reactor uses a pressurized screw in order to move the bagasse from one end of thetube to the other. Meanwhile the solids are in contact with the enzymatic complex andhydrolysis occurs with lower energy consumption (TOMÁS et al., 1997). 
The utilization of an alternative reactor design would promote a pre-hydrolysis at asolid consistency where the standard stirred tank would not be operational. After this firstpre-hydrolysis, the more liquefied substrate can be directed to a standard reactor to finishthe hydrolysis.
4.7. NEURAL NETWORK CALIBRATIONThe values generated by the optimized model were used to train an artificial neuralnetwork   to   predict   glucose   concentration   within   the   reactor.   The   input   data   wereconductance, capacitance, agitation power, accumulated solids and reactor volume. Thenetwork errors for each network architecture are presented in Figure 29 and 30. 
54Figure 29 – Artificial Neural Network Errors – Poslin and Logsig Architectures(Source: author’s collection) 55Figure 30 – Artificial Neural Network Errors – Poslin and Logsig Architectures(Source: author’s collection) 56The   majority   of   architectures   presented,   disregarding   certain   deviations,   thebehavior   shown   in   Figure   9,   except   for   the   architectures   containing   a   Pure   Linearactivation function in the hidden layer. The lowest average validation error occurred whenthe architecture contained a Tangent Sigmoid transfer function both in the hidden and sumlayers, and with 11 neurons in the hidden layer. The addition of further neurons to thisarchitecture generates an increase in the validation error, demonstrating that the optimumamount of neurons already occurred.
A  scatter   plot   of   the   simulated   glucose   values   and   the   ones   predicted   by   thenetwork is presented in Figure 31.
Figure 31 – Optimum Architecture Predicted Values(Source: author’s collection) This figure demonstrates a linear relationship between the input values and theones predicted by the ANN. The determination angular coefficient of the data is 0.994,demonstrating a strong correlation among the predicted and input values.
⁻However, at high concentrations (larger than 12 g.L ¹) the dispersion becomes lessstable. This may be explained by the fact that at these concentrations only batch data areavailable This interferes in the prediction in two ways. First, less data are available in the57region, since the fed-batch experiments did not reached these concentrations of product.
Second, these data are gathered at the final hours of the batch process, when the modelused to generate the data becomes less adequate to describe the process, generating adeviation between the available data and the actual data.
Nevertheless, the network demonstrated to be a promising tool in order to estimatethe state of the reactor online, doing so regardless of the policy used in the reactor (batchor fed-batch). This network, or a variation of it, may be used in order to estimate thereaction kinetics in real time, and thus, generate feedback information to the controllersoftware, enabling a closed-loop control strategy.
585. CONCLUSIONSThe first conclusion of this work is that the presented models were able to describethe hydrolysis to some extent. The best model was a Modified Michaelis-Mentem withproduct inhibition. A departure between the experimental and predicted values arises inlong term operations. This may be due to inhibition effects not described by the model.
Thus, further inhibition studies need to be conducted so that the model may be moreaccurate.
The ANN,  after  the architecture optimization, was capable of predicting  productconcentration from available data with a strong correlation (Determination Coefficient of0.972). Therefore, the softsensor can be tested in further studies to generate feedback ofdata to the dynamic control software, in a closed loop architecture.
The optimization software was able to generate profiles that increased the processperformance   index   while   maintaining   operational   levels   within   the   reactor,   reachingglucose concentrations close to those utilized in current first generation technology evenwhen a restriction to enzyme feed was applied (156.0 g.L ¹ of glucose after 360h) or not(168.3 g.L ¹). However, using a stirred tank, fed-batch reactor in the industrial case woulddemand a, relatively, large plant (reactors ranging from 490 to 35,000 m³). Thus, reactordesign must improved in order to adequate this technology to industrial use.
⁻⁻596. FURTHER STUDIES SUGGESTIONSFurther study suggestions include:- Performing experiments to evaluate enzymatic complex inhibition during the hydrolysis.
-   Performing   validation   experiments   with   feeding   strategies   generated   by   the   feedingoptimizer.
- Improve the optical analysis line robustness.
- Further studies with CSS in order to monitor the hydrolysis process.
- Generating a more complete model that correlates solids concentration with agitationpower.
- Optimizing the ANN further, while using other tools in order to estimate reaction kineticsmore accurately.
- Coupling a CTSR to the standard reactor to diminish the overall cost of the process.
