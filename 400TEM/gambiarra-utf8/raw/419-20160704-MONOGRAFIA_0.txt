         III  RESUMO O  objetivo  desse  trabalho  foi  quantificar  e  comparar  o  efeito  da combinação do surfactante (lauril glicosídeo) com diferentes concentrações de co-surfactante  (etanol)  na  atividade  metabólica  de  um  consórcio  de  BRS isolado de poços de recuperação. Um dos métodos de recuperação avançada de petróleo consiste na injeção de fluidos contendo surfactante e co-surfactante na  formação  rochosa.  Em  baixas  concentrações,  alguns  compostos  podem aumentar a taxa de remoção de sulfato das BRS em até 28 vezes. A maior taxa de consumo de sulfato, de 591 mg l-1 h-1, foi observada nos experimentos com 1.5%  de  etanol,  na  presença  de  0.03  e  1%  de  surfactante  e  óleo, respectivamente. Essas são as concentrações normalmente utilizadas durante a  recuperação  avançada.  Os  experimentos  indicaram  que  o  etanol  (co-surfactante)  só  começa  a  inibir  a  taxa  de  remoção  de  sulfato  de  BRS  em concentrações  acima  de  6.5%. 
Isso indica  que  a  utilização  dessas concentrações elevadas de etanol pode não só inibir a atividade de BRS, como também  melhorar  a  recuperação  de  petróleo,  aumentando  a  solubilização  do surfactante,  diminuindo  a    tensão  interfacial  água/óleo  e  molhabilidade  dos poros  da  formação  rochosa.  Assim,  esta  adaptação  nessas  concentrações pode melhorar a recuperação do óleo e ao mesmo tempo inibir a produção de sulfeto, sem a utilização de biocidas. Além disso, os resultados indicaram que o consórcio  de  BRS  mostrou  um  conjunto  de  dados  ambientalmente  mais significativo do que o modelo comumente utilizado, D. vulgaris. 
 Palavras-chave:  BRS,  etanol,  co-surfactante,  surfactante,  recuperação  de petróleo, souring          IV  ABSTRACT The aim of this research is to quantify and compare the combined effect of  surfactant  (lauryl  glycoside)  and  distinct  concentrations  of  co-surfactant (ethanol)  on  the  metabolic  activity  of  a  sulphate-reducing  bacteria  consortium isolated from oil fields. The injection of fluids in the rock formation as means to enhance oil recovery (EOR) from mature oil wells is often accompanied with the addition  of  surfactants  and  co-surfactants.    At  low  concentrations,  however, such  compounds  can  increase  SRB  sulphate  removal  rates  in  28  folds.  The highest  sulphate  consumption  rate  of  591  mg  l-1  h-1  was  observed  in experiments  with  1.5%  ethanol  in  the  presence  of  0.03  and  1%  of  surfactant and  oil,  respectively.  These  are  commonly  used  concentrations  of  such compounds during EOR. The experiments indicated that ethanol (co-surfactant) can  only  start  inhibiting  SRB  sulphate  removal  rates  at  concentrations  above 6.5%. There is indication that the use of such high ethanol concentrations can not only inhibit SRB activity, but it can also improve oil recovery by  increasing surfactant  solubilisation, lowering  water/oil interfacial tension  and  pore wettability  of  the  rock  formation.  Thus,  this  adaptation  in  such  compounds concentrations can improve oil recovery at the same time that inhibits sulphide production  without  the  supplementation  of  biocides.  In  addition,  the  results indicated  that  a  SRB  consortium  produced  a  more  environmentally  significant data than the model species D. vulgaris.

Tests were performed with a sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) consortium, which was obtained from produced water from a mature oil well,  and,  separately,  a  bacterial  model  D.  vulgaris.    Microorganisms  were preadapted to the presence of surfactant and oil and the cells were harvested at the  end  of  the  exponential  phase  for  the  tests.  Controls  of  sulphate  removal rates  were  prepared  at  distinct  conditions  in  order  to  assess  the  influence  of different carbon sources and their mixture. Treatments were prepared to assess different  concentrations  of  ethanol  in  addition  to  the  combined  presence  of surfactant  and  oil.  The  growth  kinetic  profiles  were  obtained  for  treatment  two (T2), which resulted in the highest sulphate removal rates and compared to the control two (C2). The difference of T2 to C2 was the presence of ethanol as co-surfactant.

APRESENTAÇÃO   A recuperação avançada de petróleo objetiva aproveitar a quantidade de óleo que fica retida nos poços maduros. Uma técnica muito utilizada é a injeção de soluções contendo substâncias que restauram a pressão interna do poço e melhoram  a  solubilização  do  petróleo.  Surfactantes  e  co-surfactantes  são compostos  utilizados  com  esse  propósito  porque  reduzem  a  tensão  interfacial entre a água e o óleo, aumentando a sua extração.  
Nos  poços  de  petróleo  existe  uma  alta  diversidade  de  bactérias redutoras de sulfato (BRS). O resultado do metabolismo destas é o sulfeto, um composto que pode causar corrosão nos materiais de extração e que também é  tóxico  para  os  seres  vivos  em  geral.  O  surfactante  e  o  co-surfactante geralmente  são  compostos  orgânicos,  e  por  isso,  é  possível  que  estas substâncias possam servir como fonte de carbono para as BRSs. Nesse caso, esse  processo  tem  potencial  para  aumentar  o  crescimento  dessas  BRS, intensificando assim a produção de sulfeto. Esse fenômeno é conhecido como “souring”.  Destaca-se  que  não  existe  na  literatura  trabalhos  que  relacionem  o consumo biológico desses compostos com a produção de sulfeto por BRS. 
Quantificar  o  efeito  na  produção  de  sulfeto  pela  adição  de  diferentes concentrações  de  surfactante  e  co-surfactante  é  necessário  para  inovar  no gerenciamento  do  “souring”  no  processo  de  recuperação  de  petróleo.    Além disso,  identificar  as  concentrações  nais  quais  o  surfactante  e  o  co-surfactante possam ter um efeito negativo no  “souring” permite aperfeiçoar esse processo de gerenciamento.  Nesse contexto, a meta deste trabalho foi avaliar o uso de uma  mistura  de  surfactante  com  várias  concentrações  de  um  co-surfactante alcoólico na atividade metabólica de BRS. Portanto, esse trabalho define o tipo de efeito e os intervalos dessas concentrações. 
Os resultados  mostram  que  a  produção  de  sulfeto  aumentou significativamente  no  intervalo  de  concentrações  de  0.5  a  6.5%  de  etanol.  A l-1h-1) maior taxa  de  consumo  de  sulfato  (591  mg foi  observada  na concentração  de  1.5%  de  etanol,  que  foi  28  vezes  maior  do  que  o  controle. 
Portanto,  destaca-se  que  técnicas  de  recuperação  de  petróleo  que  utilizam misturas  de  co-surfactante  entre  os  intervalos  acima  citados  aumenta  os problemas  com  “souring”.  No  entanto,  em  concentrações  acima  do  intervalo 10  citado, a toxicidade do co-surfacante (etanol) pode ser utilizada vantajosamente para controlar a produção de sulfeto.

6  7  8 1. Introduction 9 Strategies  for  increasing  the  amount  of  petroleum  extracted  from  an  oil 10 field are commonly known as the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) approaches. It 11 is  believed  that  45  to  50%  of  the  oil  present  in  the  rock  formation  is  not 12 extracted by conventional methods and it requires, for example, the use of the 13 injection of fluids (often water) commonly supplemented with chemicals such as 14 surfactants  and  co-surfactants  (Gudiña  et  al.,  2012).  The  goal  is  to  restore 15 pressure  within  the  rock  formation and  mobilize  the  oil  by  making it  more fluid 16 (Bronw, 2010; Curbello et al., 2007). 
17 Terry  et  al  (2001)  report  that  the  USA have  increased  oil  productivity  in 18 three billion barrels a year using EOR techniques. EOR procedures commonly 19 makes  use  of  low  cost  sulphonated  surfactants  (Olajire  et  al.,  2014)  but, 20 comparatively, non-ionic surfactants such as lauryl glycoside are more resistant 21 to  pH  and  salt-concentration  changes  (Attwood  e  Florence,  1983).  The  global 22 market for surfactants has been estimated at around USD$ 29.3 billions in 2014 23 with a significant contribution of non-ionic substances (PR Newswire, 2015). As 24 alkaline  agents  proved  to  be  the  cause  of  significant  drawn  back  during  oil 25 recovery (Bai et al 2013), alcohols such as ethanol is again in the interest of the 26 oil  industry  as  an  alternative  co-surfactant  agent.  The  presence  of  ethanol 27 contributes  for  the  oil-surfactant  emulsification  by  improving  the  stability  and 28 quality of the micelles (Iglauer et al., 2009). The former authors report an 85% 29 increase  in  oil  recovery  when  combining  ethanol  with  the  main  agent  alkyl 30 polyglycoside  surfactant.  The  presence  of  co-surfactant  can  also  decrease 31 surfactant losses caused by its adsorption into the rock formation (Taylor et al., 
32 2003). 
33 13  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  surfactants  and  co-surfactants  may 1 contribute  to  souring  caused  by  the  biological  production  of  sulphide,  since 2 sulphate  reducing  bacteria  (SRB)  can  use  such  organics  as  carbon  source. 
3 Corrosion  caused  by  sulphide  are  responsible  for  attacking  metallic  pipelines 4 material at a rate of 0.05 to 3 mm/year (Beech e Sunner, 2004) and it may cost 5 about  USD$  100  million/annually  for  the  oil  industry  (Bhagobaty  et  al.,  2014). 
6 Therefore,  Siciliano  et  al  (2011)  report  that  the  oil  industry  is  continually 7 increasing their investment  on  corrosion resistant  pipeline  material. 
8 Alternatively,  the  oil  industry  is  also  investing  in  the  use  of  SRB  toxic  or 9 inhibiting substances (Tanji et al., 2014). On the other hand, there is very little 10 conclusive discussion in the identification of facts that are contributing for such 11 a increase on sulphide production by SRB during EOR procedures. One of the 12 reasons  for  such  confusion  is  that  surfactant  may  act  as  both  inhibitor  and 13 stimulus to SRB metabolic activity depending on the applied concentration and 14 microbial  species  present  in  the  site.  SRB  are  heterotrophic  microbes  and,  at 15 low  concentration,  some  species  can  utilize  surfactants  and  co-surfactants  as 16 source  of  carbon  and  energy.  In  addition,  at  low  concentrations  these 17 substances  can  make  oil  more  bioavalilable  to  SRB.  At  higher  concentrations, 18 however,  surfactants  and  co-surfactant  may  interact  with  the  cell  membrane 19 becoming then toxic to SRB (Shaban et al., 2014). Thus, the use of surfactant 20 and  co-surfactant for enhancing  oil  recovery  should  take  into  account  not  only 21 specific  information  of  their  effectiveness  in  removing  oil,  but  also  information 22 indicating at what level it may cause less problems regarding biological sulphide 23 production.  
24 Surfactants are often reported as toxic at concentrations above 5x10-4 M 25 (Shaban et al., 2014). For instance, surfactant and co-surfactant, such as lauryl 26 glycoside and ethanol, are commonly toxic to microbes at concentrations above 27 2  and  4%  (w/v),  respectively.  Surprisingly,  there  is  no  information  available 28 quantifying SRB activity at concentrations below such a threshold. Hubert et al (2005)  observed  that  for  each  10.000  m3  d-1  of  injecting  water  supplemented with surfactant, sulphide may be produced at a ratio of 1.100 kg d-1. These data 29 30 31 indicate a significant relationship between sulphite production  and the injection 32 of  surfactant  and  co-surfactants.  Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  research  is  to 33 quantify  and  compare  the  combined  effect  of  surfactant  (lauryl  glycoside)  and 34 14  distinct  concentrations  of  co-surfactant  (ethanol)  on  the  metabolic  activity  of 1 sulphate-reducing bacteria commonly present in oil fields using the SRB model 2 Desulfovibrio vulgaris.  
3  4  5 2. Material and Method  6  7 2.1 Experimental set-up  8 The experimental set-up followed the rationale described in Figure 1. It is 9 based  on  the  fact  that  during  the  EOR  approach  using  surfactant  and  co-10 surfactant, the in situ SRB would be exposed to such organics and very little is 11 known about their potential metabolic response to such an input. The diagram 12 shows  that  the  experiments  were  carried  out  by  either  using  a  sulphate-13 reducing  bacteria  consortium  (SRB-consortium)  or  an  axenic  culture  of 14 Desulfovibrio vulgaris ATCC 29579. The Laboratory of Applied Microbiology at 15 UFBA  (LABEM/UFBA)  preserve  a  SRB-consortium  consisting  of  unidentified 16 microbes  isolated  from  sulphate-reducing  environments  and  produced  water 17 collected  from  oil  fields  located  at  Salvador  area,  Brazil.  The  consortium  is 18 sustained  in  mineral  medium  supplemented  with  oil  and  lactate  as  the  sole 19 carbon source. Microscopic analysis suggests the presence of about 6 distinct 20 morphological types, but it is possible to infer the presence of a higher number 21 of species within the consortium.  
22 The  experiments  were  carried  out  for  testing  the  combination  of  a 23 surfactant and oil with distinct concentrations of co-surfactant. The goal was to 24 test the effect of ethanol amendments on surfactant and oil-pre-grown SRBs by 25 measuring sulphate removal rates within a short period of time (4 hours) against 26 the  controls.  The  rational  is  that  preadapted  microbes  harvested  at  the  end  of 27 the  exponential  growth  phase  would  quickly  respond to the  ethanol 28 supplementation which maybe directly reflected on sulphate removal rates.  
29 Sulphate  was  provided in the  batch  cultures  at the  seawater 30 concentration  of  0.028  M.  Controls  were  prepared  with  mineral  media 31 supplemented  with  oil,  and  surfactant  (Fig.  1).    Thus,  in  this  experimental  set-32 up,  differences  on  sulphate  removal  rates  can  be  directly  associated  to  the 33 15  effect of the combination of surfactant and oil with distinct concentrations of co-1 surfactant (ethanol). 
2  3 2.2. Surfactant, co-surfactant and crude oil  4 The  surfactant  Laury  glycoside  was  obtained from “EMFAL  – 5 Especialidades  Quimicas  -  Brazil”  under  the  commercial  name  of  “Plantarem 6 1200”. The monomer surfactant molecular weight is estimated as 508 Da with a micellar critical concentration (MCC) at about 82 mg l-1. According to Bera et al 7 8 (2011)  and  Gharbi  et  al  (2012),  the  best  concentration  for  this  class  of 9 surfactant  during  the  EOR  approach  is  suggested  at  around  2%.  This 10 concentration  is  243  fold  higher  than  the  required  for  the  MCC.  The  used 11 concentration (0.03%) is only 4 fold higher than MCC. 
12 Ethanol  fuel  was  used  as  co-surfactant  and  it  was  acquired  from  Petrol 13 Stations  located  at  Salvador  City,  Brazil.  Dahami  (1988)  suggested  that  the 14 common  concentrations  of  ethanol  as  co-surfactant  during  the  EOR  approach 15 often vary between 0.5 and 5%. This interval was tested in this research.  
16 An oil sample was collected at “Bacia do Recôncavo Baiano – Oil Wells” 17 located  at  north  of  Salvador  City,  Brazil.  Oil  sample  used  in  this  research 18 showed a moderate viscosity (20.1 Pa.s) with an API gravity of 31.5.   
19  20 2.3 SRB cultivation, preparation and the controls  21 SRB  consortium and  D.  vulgaris  were  routinely  maintained  in  anaerobic mineral medium supplemented with lactate (9 mg l-1) according to Brandis and 22 23 Thauer  (1981),  and  oil  (1%  v/v),  according  to  Etoumi  et  al  (2008).  During 24 inoculum  preparation  medium  was  also  supplemented  with  0.03%  surfactant. 
25 Thus,  lactate,  oil  and  surfactant  were  the  combined  carbon  sources  amended 26 into  the  mineral  medium  for  inoculum  preparation.  Bacterial  density  was 27 routinely monitored using plate counting on Postgate medium (Postgate, 1965). 
28 Plates were incubated in anaerobic environment.  
29 Sulphate  concentration  in  the  mineral  media  (supplemented  or  neat) 30 before inoculation was standardized to 0.27% using sodium sulphide, following 31 the concentration commonly found in seawater.  
32  33  34 16  2.4 SRB growth kinetics 1 Growth  curve  kinetics  were  prepared  with  mineral  media  supplemented 2 with  1.5,  0.03 and  1%  of  etanol,  surfactant and oil.  Growth  kinetic  control  was 3 carried  out  with  mineral  media  suplemented  with  1%  oil,  only.  Growth  was 4 assessed  with  optic  density  (OD)  and  plate  counting  (c.u.f).  Cultures  were 5 incubated at 38 ºC and sampling carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h.  
6  7 2.5 Sulphate-removal kinetic testing  8 In  preparation  to  the  kinetic  testing,  an  overnight  culture  of  SRB-9 consortium  and  D  vulgaris  were  freshly  prepared  in  order  to  ensure  metabolic 10 synchronicity and high growth rates (12 hours of incubation).  
11 Tests  were  carried  out  using  10  ml  serum  bottles  under  anaerobic 12 preparation techniques (Postgate, 1965). Mineral media was supplemented with 13 0.27%,  1.4%  and  0.03%  of  lactate  (v/v),  oil  (v/v)  and  lauryl  glycoside  (w/v), 14 respectively.  Ethanol  was  supplemented  at  concentrations  of  0.5,  1.5,  2.5  and 15 5% (v/v), according to the treatments shown in Figure 1. Controls comprised of 16 mineral  medium  without  carbon  sources  and  mineral  media  with  only  oil  and 17 surfactant or both. 
18 A batch of 110 serum bottles of 10 ml were incubated at 38 ºC and every 19 2 hours 3 replicates were randomly selected for destructive sampling in order to 20 assess sulphate concentration, optical density and cell counts.  
21 Before inoculation the  overnight  cultures  were  centrifuged  and 22 ressuspended on saline solution without sulphate or carbon sources and it was 23 used  a  10%  inoculum  with  a  bacterial  final  start  concentration  in  the  vial  of about 104 cells. This is the average SRB density observed in produced water of 24 25 the contaminated oil wells used in this study. 
26  27 2.6 Sulphate consumption rates  28 Sulphate  concentration  was  assessed  by  the  turbidimetric  method 29 (Kolmer et al., 2000) and samples were measured using GENESYS 10S UV-vis 30 (Termo  Scientific  Ltd).  Initial  sulphate  concentration  in  the batch  cultures  were 31 of 0.028 M or 0.27%. Therefore, sulphate was never a limiting factor during the 32 experiment. A 2 ml sample was collected from the culturing vials using a sterile 33 syringe and the broth was centrifuged for removing the cells.  The supernatant 34 17  was  used  for  sulphate  concentration  analysis.  Sulphate  standard  curve  was 1 prepared  with  sodium  sulphate.  The  remaining  liquid  in  the  vial  was  used  for 2 optical density and cell counts analysis.  
3  4  5 3. Results and Discussion 6 Sulphate-reducing  bacteria (SRB)  comprise  of  a  very  diverse 7 phylogenetic  group  of  anaerobic  microbes  that  may  be  arranged  according  to 8 their  potential  metabolic  characteristics,  such  as  (i)  complete  mineralisation  of 9 organics, (ii) transformation of organics to acetate or similar low weight organics 10 and  (iii)  syntrophic  transformation of  organics  in  association  with,  for  example, 11 methanogens  (Plugge  et  al.,  2011).  SRB  metabolism  is  directly  affected  by 12 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  concentrations  which,  at  low  concentration  may 13 serve  them  as  carbon  source  (group  I  and  II),  or  at  high  concentrations  can 14 impose  them  a  toxic  response  (group  I,  II  and  III).  Therefore,  in  order  to 15 guarantee  success  in  EOR  procedures,  it  is  imperative  to  distinguish  the 16 concentration  threshold  that  can  contribute  to  sulphide  production  or  start  the 17 inhibiting control process of such production.  
18 In the case that surfactant and co-surfactant are used as carbon sources, 19 such  reaction  should  reflect  in  an  increase  of  sulphate  consumption  rate  as  it 20 generates  sulphide.  At  toxic  concentration,  however,  sulphate  removal  rates 21 should be lower or null compared to the controls because toxicity interfere with 22 such metabolic pathway. The generic stoichiometric reaction exemplifying such 23 a  sulphate-reducing  metabolism  is  shown  in  Equation  1.  In  this  formula, 24 organics are generalised as CHn. 
25  (CH)n + SO4 → 2CO2 + HS-   (Equation 1) 26 27  28 The goal of this research is to test surfactant and oil-pre-grown SRB to a 29 similar  medium  supplemented  with  distinct  concentrations  of  co-surfactant 30 (ethanol). The use of preadapted cells at the exponential growth phase is a fast 31 and reliable tool for assessing the effect of carbon sources changes or toxicity 32 in microbial metabolism (Chinalia and Killham, 2008).  
33 18  In  this  work,  sulphate-reducing  metabolic  activity  was  assessed  by 1 measuring sulphate removal rates (Equation 1) and the data compared against 2 several  combinations  of  carbon  sources  as  controls  (Fig.  1).  In  order  to  avoid 3 the delay of the microbial lag phase and decreases in sulphate removal rates, 4 cells were harvested for the testing at the end of the exponential growth phase 5 (12  h).  Thus,  the  effect  of  ethanol  supplementation  on  sulphate  removal  rates 6 could be readily assessed within a period of 4 hours.  
7 The highest sulphate consumption rate was observed at 1.5% ethanol in 8 the  presence  of  0.03%  and  1.4%  surfactant  and  oil,  respectively  (treatment  2, 9 Fig.  2  and  3).  Contrastingly,  however,  sulphate  consumption  rate  was  28  fold higher with the SRB consortium tests than with D. vulgaris (591 and 21 mg l-1 h-10 11 1, respectively). This result indicates a significant metabolic difference between 12 the  consortium  and the  model  sulphate-reducing  microbe  D.  vulgaris. 
13 Furthermore,  at  treatments  with  higher  ethanol  concentrations,  the  metabolic 14 activity  of  D.  vulgaris  was  null,  contrasting  with  the  considerable  sulphate 15 consumption  rates  observed  with  the  SRB  consortium.  Figure  4  shows  an 16 attempt to identifying the best ethanol concentration capable of increasing SRB 17 consortium  activity  in  such  a  condition.  The  results  show  that  ethanol 18 supplementation  up to  1.5%  can  significantly increase  SRB  sulphate 19 consumption  rates  (2.3  fold  compared  to  the  control  without  ethanol,  C4).  On 20 the  other  hand,  the  model  shown  in  Figure  4  suggests  that  inhibition  is  only 21 achieved  at  concentrations  higher  than  6.5%.  The  same  result  was  not 22 observed in the treatments with D. vulgaris (Fig. 3). The former bacteria showed 23 very little response to 0.5% ethanol supplementation and negative response to 24 concentrations higher than 1.5%. Figure 4, however, indicate that, in the case of 25 SRB consortium, any ethanol concentration between 0.1 to 6.5% can result in a 26 significant  increase  on  sulphate  consumption  when  compared  to  the  control 27 (mineral medium amended with surfactant and oil, C4). Thus, SRB consortium 28 is  a  more  reliable  tool  for  assessing  the  potential  effect  of  organics  during 29 sulphide production in mature oil wells environment than the model microbe, D. 
30 vulgaris.  
31  The  presence  of  surfactant  and  ethanol  in  T2  increased  3  fold  sulphate 32 removal rates of the SRB consortium when compared to the control, only when 33 oil was supplemented in the mineral media (C2, Fig. 2). Sulphate removal rates 34 19  of  the  SRB  consortium  on  surfactant,  as  sole  carbon  source  (C3,  Fig.  2),  was 1 1.6 fold higher than the observed in rich Postage medium. This result indicates 2 that  the  SRB  microbes  were  adapted  to  using  surfactant  or  even  ethanol  as 3 carbon  source.  Thus,  the  preadaptation  of  the  SRB  consortium  to  surfactant 4 and  oil  may  have  influenced  the  higher  sulphate  removal  ratios  on  surfactant 5 than  when  compared  with  rich  Postgate  media.  The  slope  of  the  consumption 6 rate curve shown in Figure 1, treatment C5, does not clearly indicate a potential 7 lag phase period. However, it is possible that the difference in the consumption 8 rates  between  SRB  consortium  in  the  C5  and  C3  controls,  may  be  related  to 9 metabolic re-adaptation to Postgate rich medium.  
10 Zhou et al (2015) showed that some SRB species could utilize ethanol as 11 carbon  source.  Figure  3  indicates  that,  in  spite  the  fact  that  D.  vulgaris  can process the surfactant (sulphate removal rate of 61 mg l-1 h-1 in C3); it respond 12 13 negatively  to  the  presence  of  high  concentrations  of  ethanol  (Fig.  3).  The 14 mixture of surfactant and oil (C4) induced a higher sulphate removal rate for D. 
15 vulgaris than the medium supplied with these substances separately. 
16  Specific growth rates values obtained with Figure 5 data corroborate with 17 the distinct sulphate removal rates assessed with mineral media supplemented 18 with  oil  only  (C2),  or  with  the  combination  of  surfactant,  oil  and  ethanol  (T2), 19 Figure  2.  The  growth  kinetics  of  the  SRB  consortium  shown  on  Figure  5 20 indicates  that  the  end  of  the  exponential  phase  is  around  12  h  and  that  OD 21 significantly correlates with the LN transformed values of colony  formation unit 22 (c.f.u.).  
23  The  data  shown  in  this  research  indicates  that  sulphate  removal  rates 24 were  not  only  influenced  by  modifications  in  the  biodisponibilisation  of  the  oil 25 caused by the addition of surfactant and co-surfactant (ethanol). Comparing the 26 sulphate removal rates obtained with C1 and C3 (Fig. 1, 2 and 3), it is clear that 27 SRB consortium and D. vulgaris were capable of using either the surfactant or 28 the ethanol as the sole carbon source for sustaining their metabolism. Lu et al (2013) demonstrated that surfactant at concentrations as high as 700 mg l-1 is 29 30 responsible  to  sustaining  or  even  increasing  microbial  biomass.  Contrastingly, 31 however,  Badawi  et  al  (2010)  observed  a  3  Log  reduction  on  Desulfomonas pigra biomass at surfactants concentration of 5 g l-1. Therefore, it is not only the 32 33 oil recovery efficiency allied with maximum low costs that should determine the 34 20  amount of surfactant and co-surfactant used for sustaining an EOR procedure. 
1 If the surfactant is used at significantly high concentrations this fact may confer 2 some  protection  against  oil  souring  based  on  such  compound  capability  of 3 inhibiting sulphate reducing bacteria. It would be not difficult to forecast savings 4 with the replacement of biocides during EOR procedure. Apart from often being 5 less  expensive  than  biocides,  higher  amounts  of  ethanol  can  also  significantly 6 assist  in  oil  recovery.  The  sector  spends  USD$  2  billion  with  biocides  in  their 7 attempt of avoiding such losses (Badawi et al., 2010). 
8  In  addition  to  SRB  inhibition,  Tawfik  and  Negm  (2016)  report  that 9 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  can  be  used  as  a  chemical  corrosion-inhibiting 10 agent for carbon steel. The fact is that adsorption of a surfactant enhances the 11 corrosion  resisting  property  of  the  metal.  This  effect  is  commonly  observed  at 12 surfactant  concentrations  above  the  critical  micellar  concentration  (CMC).  As 13 time elapses, however, biodegradation decreases surfactant concentration and 14 chemical  corrosion  may  then  take  place.  Nonetheless,  the  application  of 15 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  at  the  right  concentration  may  be  a  better 16 alternative for controlling sulphide biological production and chemical corrosion 17 than the alternatives such as biocides. In 1996, for instance, the cost associated 18 with microbial induced corrosion was estimated as between US$ 30 to 50 billion 19 for  the  oil  industry  (Vaidya  et  al.,  1996).  Therefore,  the  correct  application  of 20 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  may  significantly  contribute  to  reducing  such 21 expenses. Furthermore, the supplementation with co-surfactant as ethanol can 22 also not only increase oil recovery, but also assist in inhibiting SRB metabolism. 
23 Toxic surfactant oil concentration is often reported at concentrations above 2% 24 (Bera  and  Mandal,  2014).  Distinct  species  have  different  tolerance  to  toxic 25 compounds and, in the case of ethanol, this research has shown that the toxic 26 threshold for the SRB consortium is above 6.5% of ethanol (v/v).  
27  In  addition  to  SRB  inhibition,  ethanol  increases  oil/water  emulsion 28 coalescence  rates  creating  smaller  micellar  aggregates,  which  contributes  to 29 lower  probability  of  pore  plugging  improving  EOR  procedures  (Dahami  et  al., 
30 1988).  Ethanol  is  also  used  for  improving  surfactant  solubilisation  (2  fold)  in 31 water  (Taylor  et  al.,  2003).  Nonetheless,  it  should  be  highlighted  that  water 32 soluble alcohol improve oil solubility whilst less water soluble alcohols increase 33 interfacial tension between oil and water. Thus, less water soluble alcohols have 34 21  a  negative  effect  on  EOR  procedure  whilst  water  soluble  can  increase  oil 1 recovery  in  about  10%  (Dahami  et  al.,  1988).  High  interfacial  tension  between 2 oil and water phase causes the injected water to bypass the residual oil. On the 3 other hand, lower interfacial tension will not only improve oil flow, but it will also 4 favour  pore  wettability  in  the  rock  formation.  Thus,  surfactant  and  ethanol 5 mixture  can  be  a  good  alternative  for  improving  pore  wettability,  which  is 6 another  pivotal  variable  hindering  oil  recovery  from  mature  wells  (Jamaloei  et 7 al., 2011).  
8 In  conclusion,  this  research  shows  that  the  injection  of  liquid  containing 9 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  into  the  oil  formation  can  significantly  enhance 10 sulphide production if their concentrations are below the toxic threshold. On the 11 other hand, if a combination of surfactant and co-surfactants are injected in the 12 rock  formation  at  microbial  inhibiting  concentrations,  this  practice  shows  the 13 potential for increasing not only oil recovery, but it may also control souring.

If you agree, your article will be transferred automatically  on  your  behalf  with  no  need  to  reformat.  Please  note  that  your  article  will be reviewed again by the new journal. 
Submission Our  online  submission  system  guides  you  stepwise  through  the  process  of  entering  your article details and uploading your files. The system converts your article files to a single PDF file  used  in  the  peer-review  process.  Editable  files  (e.g.,  Word,  LaTeX)  are  required  to typeset  your  article  for  final  publication.  All  correspondence,  including  notification  of  the Editor's decision and requests for revision, is sent by e-mail. 
Submit your article Please submit your article via http://ees.elsevier.com/bite. 
Referees . 
34  Please  submit,  with  the  manuscript,  the  names,  addresses  and  e-mail  addresses  of  5 potential  referees.  Note  that  the  editor  retains  the  sole  right  to  decide  whether  or  not  the suggested  reviewers  are  used.  The  Executive  Editor  first  evaluates  all  manuscripts  on technical aspects such as compliance to the Guide For Authors, quality of grammar or English language.  Revision  can  be  requested.  Manuscripts  accepted  at  this  stage  are  passed  to  the handling  editor  who  can  also  reject  on  the  basis  of  insufficient  originality,  serious  scientific flaws,  or  because  the  work  is  considered  outside  the  aims  and  scope  of  the  journal.  Those that  meet  the  minimum  criteria  are  passed  on  to  experts  for  review.  Referees  advise  the editor, who is responsible for the final decision to accept or reject the article.  Please note: Any  Editor's  decision  is  final.  Manuscripts  previously  rejected  by  the  Journal  will  not  be  re-considered by the Editors, and therefore will be rejected without review. 
 PREPARATION Manuscript Preparation General: Authors  must  follow  guide  for  authors  strictly,  failing  which  the  manuscripts  would  be rejected without review. Editors reserve the right to adjust the style to certain standards of uniformity. 
Structure: Follow  this  order  when  typing  manuscripts:  Title,  Authors,  Affiliations,  Abstract,  Keywords, Introduction,  Materials Conclusions, Acknowledgements,  References,  Figure  Captions,  Tables  and  Figures.  The  corresponding author  should  be  identified  with  an  asterisk  and  footnote.  All  other  footnotes  (except  for table  footnotes)  should  be  avoided.  Collate  acknowledgements  in  a  separate  section  at  the end  of  the  article  and  do  not  include  them  on  the  title  page,  as  a  footnote  to  the  title  or otherwise. 
Text Layout: Use double spacing and wide (3 cm) margins on white paper. (Avoid full justification, i.e., do not use a constant right-hand margin.) Ensure that each new paragraph is clearly indicated. 
Present  tables  and  figure  legends  on  separate  pages  at  the  end  of  the  manuscript.  If possible,  consult  a  recent  issue  of  the  journal  to  become  familiar  with  layout  and conventions. Number all pages consecutively, use 12 pt font size and standard fonts. 
Page  length:  Maximum  page  length  should  be  15,  35  and  40  pages  for  Short Communication,  Original  article/case  study  and  review  paper,  including  text,  references, tables and figures. Each figure and table must be put separately on a single page. 
Use of word processing software It  is  important  that  the  file  be  saved  in  the  native  format  of  the  word  processor  used.  The text  should  be  in  single-column  format.  Keep  the  layout  of  the  text  as  simple  as  possible. 
Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the Word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. 
The  electronic  text  should  be  prepared  in  a  way  very  similar  to  that  of  conventional manuscripts (see also the Guide to Publishing with Elsevier). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. 
See also the section on Electronic artwork. 
To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor. 
LaTeX You  are  recommended  to  use  the  Elsevier  article  class  elsarticle.cls  to  prepare  your manuscript  and  BibTeX  to  generate  your  bibliography.  Our  LaTeX  site  has  detailed submission instructions, templates and other information. 
 Article structure Subdivision - numbered sections Divide  your  article  into  clearly  defined  and  numbered  sections.  Subsections  should  be numbered  1.1  (then  1.1.1,  1.1.2,  ...),  1.2,  etc.  (the  abstract  is  not  included  in  section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. 
Introduction State  the  objectives  of  the  work  and  provide  an  adequate  background,  avoiding  a  detailed literature survey or a summary of the results. 
Results and  Methods, and  Discussion, 35  Material and methods Provide  sufficient  detail  to  allow  the  work  to  be  reproduced.  Methods  already  published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described. 
Theory/calculation A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis. 
Results and Discussion Results  should  be  clear  and  concise,  and  be  part  of  a  single  section,  discussing  the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. Extensive citation and discussion of the published literature should be avoided. 
Conclusions The main conclusions drawn from results should be presented in a short Conclusions section (maximum 100 words). 
Appendices If  there  is  more  than  one  appendix,  they  should  be  identified  as  A,  B,  etc.  Formulae  and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent  appendix,  Eq.  (B.1)  and  so  on.  Similarly  for  tables  and  figures:  Table  A.1;  Fig. 
A.1, etc. 
 Essential title page information • Title. Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible. 
•  Author  names  and  affiliations.  Please  clearly  indicate  the  given  name(s)  and  family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors' affiliation  addresses  (where  the  actual  work  was  done)  below  the  names.  Indicate  all affiliations  with  a  lowercase  superscript  letter  immediately  after  the  author's  name  and  in front of the appropriate address. 
Provide  the  full  postal  address  of  each  affiliation,  including  the  country  name  and,  if available, the e-mail address of each author. 
•  Corresponding  author.  Clearly  indicate  who  will  handle  correspondence  at  all  stages  of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author. 
•  Present/permanent  address.  If  an  author  has  moved  since  the  work  described  in  the article  was  done,  or  was  visiting  at  the  time,  a  'Present  address'  (or  'Permanent  address') may  be  indicated  as  a  footnote  to  that  author's  name.  The  address  at  which  the  author actually  did  the  work  must  be  retained  as  the  main,  affiliation  address.  Superscript  Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes. 
There  can  be  only  one  person  as  corresponding  author  and  manuscript  must  be submitted by the corresponding author in EES. 
 Abstract A concise and factual abstract is required. Each paper should be provided with an abstract of about  100-150  words.  The  abstract  should  state  briefly  the  purpose  of  the  research,  the principal  results  and  major  conclusions.  An  abstract  is  often  presented  separately  from  the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if  essential,  then  cite  the  author(s)  and  year(s).  Also,  non-standard  or  uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. 
Graphical abstract Although a graphical abstract is optional, its use is encouraged as it draws more attention to the  online  article.  The  graphical  abstract  should  summarize  the  contents  of  the  article  in  a concise,  pictorial  form  designed  to  capture  the  attention  of  a  wide  readership.  Graphical abstracts  should  be  submitted  as  a  separate  file  in  the  online  submission  system.  Image size:  Please  provide  an  image  with  a  minimum  of  531  ×  1328  pixels  (h  ×  w)  or proportionally  more.  The  image  should  be  readable  at  a  size  of  5  ×  13  cm  using  a  regular screen  resolution  of  96  dpi.  Preferred  file  types:  TIFF,  EPS,  PDF  or  MS  Office  files.  You  can view Example Graphical Abstracts on our information site. Authors can make use of Elsevier's Illustration and Enhancement service to ensure the Best presentation of their images and in accordance with all technical requirements: Illustration Service. 
Highlights Highlights  are  mandatory  for  this  journal.  They  consist  of  a  short  collection  of  bullet  points that  convey  the  core  findings  of  the  article  and  should  be  submitted  in  a  separate  editable file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 36  5  bullet  points  (maximum  85  characters,  including  spaces,  per  bullet  point).  You  can  view example Highlights on our information site. 
Keywords Immediately  after  the  abstract,  provide  a  maximum  of  5  keywords  to  be  included  in  an article, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid,  for  example,  "and",  "of").  Be  sparing  with  abbreviations:  only  abbreviations  firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes. 
Abbreviations Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first Page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at  their  first  mention  there,  as  well  as  in  the  footnote.  Ensure  consistency  of  abbreviations throughout the article. 
Acknowledgements Collate  acknowledgements  in  a  separate  section  at  the  end  of  the  article  before  the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.). 
Formatting of funding sources List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements: Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa]. 
It  is  not  necessary  to  include  detailed  descriptions  on  the  program  or  type  of  grants  and awards.  When  funding  is  from  a  block  grant  or  other  resources  available  to  a  university, college,  or  other  research  institution,  submit  the  name  of  the  institute  or  organization  that provided  the  funding.  If  no  funding  has  been  provided  for  the  research,  please  include  the following sentence: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. 
Units Follow  internationally  accepted  rules  and  conventions:  use  the international  system of  units (SI). If other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI. 
Math formulae Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line  with  normal  text  where  possible  and  use  the  solidus  (/)  instead  of  a  horizontal  line  for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number  consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text). 
Footnotes Footnotes  should  be  used  sparingly.  Number  them  consecutively  throughout  the  article. 
Many  Word  processors  can  build  footnotes  into  the  text,  and  this  feature  may  be  used. 
Otherwise,  please  indicate  the  position  of  footnotes  in  the  text  and  list  the  footnotes themselves  separately  at  the  end  of  the  article.  Do  not  include  footnotes  in  the  Reference list. 
 Artwork Electronic artwork General points • Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork. 
• Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option. 
•  Aim  to  use  the  following  fonts  in  your  illustrations:  Arial,  Courier,  Times  New  Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar. 
• Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text. 
• Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files. 
• Provide captions to illustrations separately. 
• Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version. 
• Submit each illustration as a separate file. 
A detailed guide on electronic artwork is available. 
You  are  urged  to  visit  this  site;  some  excerpts  from  the  detailed  information  are given here. 
Formats  If  your  electronic  artwork  is  created  in  a  Microsoft  Office  application  (Word,  PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format. 
Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the 37  resolution  requirements  for  line  drawings,  halftones,  and  line/halftone  combinations  given below): EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts. 
TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi. 
TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black & white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi. 
TIFF  (or  JPEG):  Combinations  bitmapped  line/half-tone  (color  or  grayscale),  keep  to  a minimum of 500 dpi. 
Please do not: • Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors; • Supply files that are too low in resolution; • Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content. 
Color artwork Please  make  sure  that  artwork  files  are  in  an  acceptable  format  (TIFF  (or  JPEG),  EPS  (or PDF),  or  MS  Office  files)  and  with  the  correct  resolution.  If,  together  with  your  accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these  figures  will  appear  in  color  online  (e.g.,  ScienceDirect  and  other  sites)  regardless  of whether  or  not  these  illustrations  are  reproduced  in  color  in  the  printed  version.  For  color reproduction in print, you will receive information regarding the costs from Elsevier after receipt of your accepted article.  Please  indicate  your  preference  for  color: in  print or online only. Further information on the preparation of electronic artwork. 
Figure captions Ensure  that  each  illustration  has  a  caption.  Supply  captions  separately,  not  attached  to  the figure.  A  caption  should  comprise  a  brief title  (not on  the  figure  itself)  and  a  description  of the  illustration.  Keep  text  in  the  illustrations  themselves  to  a  minimum  but  explain  all symbols  and  abbreviations  used.  Note  that  the  maximum  number  of  figures  allowed  for Original article, case study, and review papers is 6. Multiple figures can be expressed as one figure  (for  e.g.  1a,  1b,  1c  etc...),  while  retaining  the  maximum  limit  of  6.The  Journal discourages  publication  of  simple  one  line  graphs/figures,  pattern  figures,  conventional spectra (X-ray, FTIR, UV, NMR, etc) and SEM photographs of a routine nature. 
Tables Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text. Place footnotes to  tables  below  the  table  body  and  indicate  them  with  superscript  lowercase  letters.  Avoid vertical rules. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in tables do not  duplicate  results  described  elsewhere  in  the  article.  Note  that  the  maximum  number  of figures allowed for Original  article,  case  study,  and  review  papers  is  6.  The  Journal  discourages  publication  of simple  one  parameter  tables;  such  information  should  be  preferably  described  in  the  text itself. 
References Maximum 25, 50 and 100 references for short communication, original research paper/case study and review papers, respectively. 
Citation in text Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice  versa).  Any  references  cited  in  the  abstract  must  be  given  in  full.  Unpublished  results and  personal  communications  are  not  recommended  in  the  reference  list,  but  may  be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the  standard  reference  style  of  the  journal  and  should  include  a  substitution  of  the publication  date  with  either  'Unpublished  results'  or  'Personal  communication'.  Citation  of  a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication. 
Web references As  a  minimum,  the  full  URL  should  be  given  and  the  date  when  the  reference  was  last accessed.  Any  further  information,  if  known  (DOI,  author  names,  dates,  reference  to  a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., 
after  the  reference  list)  under  a  different  heading  if  desired,  or  can  be  included  in  the reference list. 
References in a special issue Please  ensure  that  the  words  'this  issue'  are  added  to  any  references  in  the  list  (and  any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue. 
Reference management software Most  Elsevier  journals  have  their  reference  template  available  in  many  of  the  most  popular reference  management  software  products.  These  include  all  products  that  support  Citation Style  Language  styles,  such  as  Mendeley  and  Zotero,  as  well  as  EndNote.  Using  the  word 38  processor plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template  when  preparing  their  article,  after  which  citations  and  bibliographies  will  be automatically formatted in the journal's style. If no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this Guide. Users of  Mendeley  Desktop  can  easily  install  the  reference  style  for  this  journal  by  clicking  the following  link:  http://open.mendeley.com/use-citation-style/bioresource-technology.  When preparing  your  manuscript,  you  will  then  be  able  to  select  this  style  using  the  Mendeley plugins for Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. 
Reference style Text: All citations in the text should refer to: 1. Single author: the author's name (without initials, unless there is ambiguity) and the year of publication; 2. Two authors: both authors' names and the year of publication; 3. Three or more authors: first author's name followed by 'et al.' and the year of publication. 
Citations  may  be  made  directly  (or  parenthetically).  Examples:  'as  demonstrated  (Allan, 2000a, 2000b, 1999; Allan and Jones, 1999). Kramer et al. (2010) have recently shown ....' 
List:  References  should  be  arranged  first  alphabetically,  THEN  NUMBERED  NUMERICALLY, and then further sorted chronologically if necessary. More than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., placed after the year of publication.

 AFTER ACCEPTANCE Publication of Articles After  acceptance  the  Journal  will  publish  articles  quickly  both  online  and  in  print.  Requests for delayed publication of the accepted articles are generally not acceptable. 
Online proof correction Corresponding  authors  will  receive  an  e-mail  with  a  link  to  our  online  proofing  system, allowing annotation and correction of proofs online. The environment is similar to MS Word: in  addition  to  editing  text,  you  can  also  comment  on  figures/tables  and  answer  questions from the Copy Editor. 
Web-based  proofing  provides  a  faster  and  less  error-prone  process  by  allowing  you  to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors. 
40  If  preferred,  you  can  still choose  to  annotate  and  upload  your  edits  on  the  PDF  version.  All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF. 
We  will  do  everything  possible  to  get  your  article  published  quickly  and  accurately.  Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication. Please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.

         III  RESUMO O  objetivo  desse  trabalho  foi  quantificar  e  comparar  o  efeito  da combinação do surfactante (lauril glicosídeo) com diferentes concentrações de co-surfactante  (etanol)  na  atividade  metabólica  de  um  consórcio  de  BRS isolado de poços de recuperação. Um dos métodos de recuperação avançada de petróleo consiste na injeção de fluidos contendo surfactante e co-surfactante na  formação  rochosa.  Em  baixas  concentrações,  alguns  compostos  podem aumentar a taxa de remoção de sulfato das BRS em até 28 vezes. A maior taxa de consumo de sulfato, de 591 mg l-1 h-1, foi observada nos experimentos com 1.5%  de  etanol,  na  presença  de  0.03  e  1%  de  surfactante  e  óleo, respectivamente. Essas são as concentrações normalmente utilizadas durante a  recuperação  avançada.  Os  experimentos  indicaram  que  o  etanol  (co-surfactante)  só  começa  a  inibir  a  taxa  de  remoção  de  sulfato  de  BRS  em concentrações  acima  de  6.5%. 
Isso indica  que  a  utilização  dessas concentrações elevadas de etanol pode não só inibir a atividade de BRS, como também  melhorar  a  recuperação  de  petróleo,  aumentando  a  solubilização  do surfactante,  diminuindo  a    tensão  interfacial  água/óleo  e  molhabilidade  dos poros  da  formação  rochosa.  Assim,  esta  adaptação  nessas  concentrações pode melhorar a recuperação do óleo e ao mesmo tempo inibir a produção de sulfeto, sem a utilização de biocidas. Além disso, os resultados indicaram que o consórcio  de  BRS  mostrou  um  conjunto  de  dados  ambientalmente  mais significativo do que o modelo comumente utilizado, D. vulgaris. 
 Palavras-chave:  BRS,  etanol,  co-surfactante,  surfactante,  recuperação  de petróleo, souring          IV  ABSTRACT The aim of this research is to quantify and compare the combined effect of  surfactant  (lauryl  glycoside)  and  distinct  concentrations  of  co-surfactant (ethanol)  on  the  metabolic  activity  of  a  sulphate-reducing  bacteria  consortium isolated from oil fields. The injection of fluids in the rock formation as means to enhance oil recovery (EOR) from mature oil wells is often accompanied with the addition  of  surfactants  and  co-surfactants.    At  low  concentrations,  however, such  compounds  can  increase  SRB  sulphate  removal  rates  in  28  folds.  The highest  sulphate  consumption  rate  of  591  mg  l-1  h-1  was  observed  in experiments  with  1.5%  ethanol  in  the  presence  of  0.03  and  1%  of  surfactant and  oil,  respectively.  These  are  commonly  used  concentrations  of  such compounds during EOR. The experiments indicated that ethanol (co-surfactant) can  only  start  inhibiting  SRB  sulphate  removal  rates  at  concentrations  above 6.5%. There is indication that the use of such high ethanol concentrations can not only inhibit SRB activity, but it can also improve oil recovery by  increasing surfactant  solubilisation, lowering  water/oil interfacial tension  and  pore wettability  of  the  rock  formation.  Thus,  this  adaptation  in  such  compounds concentrations can improve oil recovery at the same time that inhibits sulphide production  without  the  supplementation  of  biocides.  In  addition,  the  results indicated  that  a  SRB  consortium  produced  a  more  environmentally  significant data than the model species D. vulgaris.

Tests were performed with a sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) consortium, which was obtained from produced water from a mature oil well,  and,  separately,  a  bacterial  model  D.  vulgaris.    Microorganisms  were preadapted to the presence of surfactant and oil and the cells were harvested at the  end  of  the  exponential  phase  for  the  tests.  Controls  of  sulphate  removal rates  were  prepared  at  distinct  conditions  in  order  to  assess  the  influence  of different carbon sources and their mixture. Treatments were prepared to assess different  concentrations  of  ethanol  in  addition  to  the  combined  presence  of surfactant  and  oil.  The  growth  kinetic  profiles  were  obtained  for  treatment  two (T2), which resulted in the highest sulphate removal rates and compared to the control two (C2). The difference of T2 to C2 was the presence of ethanol as co-surfactant.

APRESENTAÇÃO   A recuperação avançada de petróleo objetiva aproveitar a quantidade de óleo que fica retida nos poços maduros. Uma técnica muito utilizada é a injeção de soluções contendo substâncias que restauram a pressão interna do poço e melhoram  a  solubilização  do  petróleo.  Surfactantes  e  co-surfactantes  são compostos  utilizados  com  esse  propósito  porque  reduzem  a  tensão  interfacial entre a água e o óleo, aumentando a sua extração.  
Nos  poços  de  petróleo  existe  uma  alta  diversidade  de  bactérias redutoras de sulfato (BRS). O resultado do metabolismo destas é o sulfeto, um composto que pode causar corrosão nos materiais de extração e que também é  tóxico  para  os  seres  vivos  em  geral.  O  surfactante  e  o  co-surfactante geralmente  são  compostos  orgânicos,  e  por  isso,  é  possível  que  estas substâncias possam servir como fonte de carbono para as BRSs. Nesse caso, esse  processo  tem  potencial  para  aumentar  o  crescimento  dessas  BRS, intensificando assim a produção de sulfeto. Esse fenômeno é conhecido como “souring”.  Destaca-se  que  não  existe  na  literatura  trabalhos  que  relacionem  o consumo biológico desses compostos com a produção de sulfeto por BRS. 
Quantificar  o  efeito  na  produção  de  sulfeto  pela  adição  de  diferentes concentrações  de  surfactante  e  co-surfactante  é  necessário  para  inovar  no gerenciamento  do  “souring”  no  processo  de  recuperação  de  petróleo.    Além disso,  identificar  as  concentrações  nais  quais  o  surfactante  e  o  co-surfactante possam ter um efeito negativo no  “souring” permite aperfeiçoar esse processo de gerenciamento.  Nesse contexto, a meta deste trabalho foi avaliar o uso de uma  mistura  de  surfactante  com  várias  concentrações  de  um  co-surfactante alcoólico na atividade metabólica de BRS. Portanto, esse trabalho define o tipo de efeito e os intervalos dessas concentrações. 
Os resultados  mostram  que  a  produção  de  sulfeto  aumentou significativamente  no  intervalo  de  concentrações  de  0.5  a  6.5%  de  etanol.  A l-1h-1) maior taxa  de  consumo  de  sulfato  (591  mg foi  observada  na concentração  de  1.5%  de  etanol,  que  foi  28  vezes  maior  do  que  o  controle. 
Portanto,  destaca-se  que  técnicas  de  recuperação  de  petróleo  que  utilizam misturas  de  co-surfactante  entre  os  intervalos  acima  citados  aumenta  os problemas  com  “souring”.  No  entanto,  em  concentrações  acima  do  intervalo 10  citado, a toxicidade do co-surfacante (etanol) pode ser utilizada vantajosamente para controlar a produção de sulfeto.

6  7  8 1. Introduction 9 Strategies  for  increasing  the  amount  of  petroleum  extracted  from  an  oil 10 field are commonly known as the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) approaches. It 11 is  believed  that  45  to  50%  of  the  oil  present  in  the  rock  formation  is  not 12 extracted by conventional methods and it requires, for example, the use of the 13 injection of fluids (often water) commonly supplemented with chemicals such as 14 surfactants  and  co-surfactants  (Gudiña  et  al.,  2012).  The  goal  is  to  restore 15 pressure  within  the  rock  formation and  mobilize  the  oil  by  making it  more fluid 16 (Bronw, 2010; Curbello et al., 2007). 
17 Terry  et  al  (2001)  report  that  the  USA have  increased  oil  productivity  in 18 three billion barrels a year using EOR techniques. EOR procedures commonly 19 makes  use  of  low  cost  sulphonated  surfactants  (Olajire  et  al.,  2014)  but, 20 comparatively, non-ionic surfactants such as lauryl glycoside are more resistant 21 to  pH  and  salt-concentration  changes  (Attwood  e  Florence,  1983).  The  global 22 market for surfactants has been estimated at around USD$ 29.3 billions in 2014 23 with a significant contribution of non-ionic substances (PR Newswire, 2015). As 24 alkaline  agents  proved  to  be  the  cause  of  significant  drawn  back  during  oil 25 recovery (Bai et al 2013), alcohols such as ethanol is again in the interest of the 26 oil  industry  as  an  alternative  co-surfactant  agent.  The  presence  of  ethanol 27 contributes  for  the  oil-surfactant  emulsification  by  improving  the  stability  and 28 quality of the micelles (Iglauer et al., 2009). The former authors report an 85% 29 increase  in  oil  recovery  when  combining  ethanol  with  the  main  agent  alkyl 30 polyglycoside  surfactant.  The  presence  of  co-surfactant  can  also  decrease 31 surfactant losses caused by its adsorption into the rock formation (Taylor et al., 
32 2003). 
33 13  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  surfactants  and  co-surfactants  may 1 contribute  to  souring  caused  by  the  biological  production  of  sulphide,  since 2 sulphate  reducing  bacteria  (SRB)  can  use  such  organics  as  carbon  source. 
3 Corrosion  caused  by  sulphide  are  responsible  for  attacking  metallic  pipelines 4 material at a rate of 0.05 to 3 mm/year (Beech e Sunner, 2004) and it may cost 5 about  USD$  100  million/annually  for  the  oil  industry  (Bhagobaty  et  al.,  2014). 
6 Therefore,  Siciliano  et  al  (2011)  report  that  the  oil  industry  is  continually 7 increasing their investment  on  corrosion resistant  pipeline  material. 
8 Alternatively,  the  oil  industry  is  also  investing  in  the  use  of  SRB  toxic  or 9 inhibiting substances (Tanji et al., 2014). On the other hand, there is very little 10 conclusive discussion in the identification of facts that are contributing for such 11 a increase on sulphide production by SRB during EOR procedures. One of the 12 reasons  for  such  confusion  is  that  surfactant  may  act  as  both  inhibitor  and 13 stimulus to SRB metabolic activity depending on the applied concentration and 14 microbial  species  present  in  the  site.  SRB  are  heterotrophic  microbes  and,  at 15 low  concentration,  some  species  can  utilize  surfactants  and  co-surfactants  as 16 source  of  carbon  and  energy.  In  addition,  at  low  concentrations  these 17 substances  can  make  oil  more  bioavalilable  to  SRB.  At  higher  concentrations, 18 however,  surfactants  and  co-surfactant  may  interact  with  the  cell  membrane 19 becoming then toxic to SRB (Shaban et al., 2014). Thus, the use of surfactant 20 and  co-surfactant for enhancing  oil  recovery  should  take  into  account  not  only 21 specific  information  of  their  effectiveness  in  removing  oil,  but  also  information 22 indicating at what level it may cause less problems regarding biological sulphide 23 production.  
24 Surfactants are often reported as toxic at concentrations above 5x10-4 M 25 (Shaban et al., 2014). For instance, surfactant and co-surfactant, such as lauryl 26 glycoside and ethanol, are commonly toxic to microbes at concentrations above 27 2  and  4%  (w/v),  respectively.  Surprisingly,  there  is  no  information  available 28 quantifying SRB activity at concentrations below such a threshold. Hubert et al (2005)  observed  that  for  each  10.000  m3  d-1  of  injecting  water  supplemented with surfactant, sulphide may be produced at a ratio of 1.100 kg d-1. These data 29 30 31 indicate a significant relationship between sulphite production  and the injection 32 of  surfactant  and  co-surfactants.  Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  research  is  to 33 quantify  and  compare  the  combined  effect  of  surfactant  (lauryl  glycoside)  and 34 14  distinct  concentrations  of  co-surfactant  (ethanol)  on  the  metabolic  activity  of 1 sulphate-reducing bacteria commonly present in oil fields using the SRB model 2 Desulfovibrio vulgaris.  
3  4  5 2. Material and Method  6  7 2.1 Experimental set-up  8 The experimental set-up followed the rationale described in Figure 1. It is 9 based  on  the  fact  that  during  the  EOR  approach  using  surfactant  and  co-10 surfactant, the in situ SRB would be exposed to such organics and very little is 11 known about their potential metabolic response to such an input. The diagram 12 shows  that  the  experiments  were  carried  out  by  either  using  a  sulphate-13 reducing  bacteria  consortium  (SRB-consortium)  or  an  axenic  culture  of 14 Desulfovibrio vulgaris ATCC 29579. The Laboratory of Applied Microbiology at 15 UFBA  (LABEM/UFBA)  preserve  a  SRB-consortium  consisting  of  unidentified 16 microbes  isolated  from  sulphate-reducing  environments  and  produced  water 17 collected  from  oil  fields  located  at  Salvador  area,  Brazil.  The  consortium  is 18 sustained  in  mineral  medium  supplemented  with  oil  and  lactate  as  the  sole 19 carbon source. Microscopic analysis suggests the presence of about 6 distinct 20 morphological types, but it is possible to infer the presence of a higher number 21 of species within the consortium.  
22 The  experiments  were  carried  out  for  testing  the  combination  of  a 23 surfactant and oil with distinct concentrations of co-surfactant. The goal was to 24 test the effect of ethanol amendments on surfactant and oil-pre-grown SRBs by 25 measuring sulphate removal rates within a short period of time (4 hours) against 26 the  controls.  The  rational  is  that  preadapted  microbes  harvested  at  the  end  of 27 the  exponential  growth  phase  would  quickly  respond to the  ethanol 28 supplementation which maybe directly reflected on sulphate removal rates.  
29 Sulphate  was  provided in the  batch  cultures  at the  seawater 30 concentration  of  0.028  M.  Controls  were  prepared  with  mineral  media 31 supplemented  with  oil,  and  surfactant  (Fig.  1).    Thus,  in  this  experimental  set-32 up,  differences  on  sulphate  removal  rates  can  be  directly  associated  to  the 33 15  effect of the combination of surfactant and oil with distinct concentrations of co-1 surfactant (ethanol). 
2  3 2.2. Surfactant, co-surfactant and crude oil  4 The  surfactant  Laury  glycoside  was  obtained from “EMFAL  – 5 Especialidades  Quimicas  -  Brazil”  under  the  commercial  name  of  “Plantarem 6 1200”. The monomer surfactant molecular weight is estimated as 508 Da with a micellar critical concentration (MCC) at about 82 mg l-1. According to Bera et al 7 8 (2011)  and  Gharbi  et  al  (2012),  the  best  concentration  for  this  class  of 9 surfactant  during  the  EOR  approach  is  suggested  at  around  2%.  This 10 concentration  is  243  fold  higher  than  the  required  for  the  MCC.  The  used 11 concentration (0.03%) is only 4 fold higher than MCC. 
12 Ethanol  fuel  was  used  as  co-surfactant  and  it  was  acquired  from  Petrol 13 Stations  located  at  Salvador  City,  Brazil.  Dahami  (1988)  suggested  that  the 14 common  concentrations  of  ethanol  as  co-surfactant  during  the  EOR  approach 15 often vary between 0.5 and 5%. This interval was tested in this research.  
16 An oil sample was collected at “Bacia do Recôncavo Baiano – Oil Wells” 17 located  at  north  of  Salvador  City,  Brazil.  Oil  sample  used  in  this  research 18 showed a moderate viscosity (20.1 Pa.s) with an API gravity of 31.5.   
19  20 2.3 SRB cultivation, preparation and the controls  21 SRB  consortium and  D.  vulgaris  were  routinely  maintained  in  anaerobic mineral medium supplemented with lactate (9 mg l-1) according to Brandis and 22 23 Thauer  (1981),  and  oil  (1%  v/v),  according  to  Etoumi  et  al  (2008).  During 24 inoculum  preparation  medium  was  also  supplemented  with  0.03%  surfactant. 
25 Thus,  lactate,  oil  and  surfactant  were  the  combined  carbon  sources  amended 26 into  the  mineral  medium  for  inoculum  preparation.  Bacterial  density  was 27 routinely monitored using plate counting on Postgate medium (Postgate, 1965). 
28 Plates were incubated in anaerobic environment.  
29 Sulphate  concentration  in  the  mineral  media  (supplemented  or  neat) 30 before inoculation was standardized to 0.27% using sodium sulphide, following 31 the concentration commonly found in seawater.  
32  33  34 16  2.4 SRB growth kinetics 1 Growth  curve  kinetics  were  prepared  with  mineral  media  supplemented 2 with  1.5,  0.03 and  1%  of  etanol,  surfactant and oil.  Growth  kinetic  control  was 3 carried  out  with  mineral  media  suplemented  with  1%  oil,  only.  Growth  was 4 assessed  with  optic  density  (OD)  and  plate  counting  (c.u.f).  Cultures  were 5 incubated at 38 ºC and sampling carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h.  
6  7 2.5 Sulphate-removal kinetic testing  8 In  preparation  to  the  kinetic  testing,  an  overnight  culture  of  SRB-9 consortium  and  D  vulgaris  were  freshly  prepared  in  order  to  ensure  metabolic 10 synchronicity and high growth rates (12 hours of incubation).  
11 Tests  were  carried  out  using  10  ml  serum  bottles  under  anaerobic 12 preparation techniques (Postgate, 1965). Mineral media was supplemented with 13 0.27%,  1.4%  and  0.03%  of  lactate  (v/v),  oil  (v/v)  and  lauryl  glycoside  (w/v), 14 respectively.  Ethanol  was  supplemented  at  concentrations  of  0.5,  1.5,  2.5  and 15 5% (v/v), according to the treatments shown in Figure 1. Controls comprised of 16 mineral  medium  without  carbon  sources  and  mineral  media  with  only  oil  and 17 surfactant or both. 
18 A batch of 110 serum bottles of 10 ml were incubated at 38 ºC and every 19 2 hours 3 replicates were randomly selected for destructive sampling in order to 20 assess sulphate concentration, optical density and cell counts.  
21 Before inoculation the  overnight  cultures  were  centrifuged  and 22 ressuspended on saline solution without sulphate or carbon sources and it was 23 used  a  10%  inoculum  with  a  bacterial  final  start  concentration  in  the  vial  of about 104 cells. This is the average SRB density observed in produced water of 24 25 the contaminated oil wells used in this study. 
26  27 2.6 Sulphate consumption rates  28 Sulphate  concentration  was  assessed  by  the  turbidimetric  method 29 (Kolmer et al., 2000) and samples were measured using GENESYS 10S UV-vis 30 (Termo  Scientific  Ltd).  Initial  sulphate  concentration  in  the batch  cultures  were 31 of 0.028 M or 0.27%. Therefore, sulphate was never a limiting factor during the 32 experiment. A 2 ml sample was collected from the culturing vials using a sterile 33 syringe and the broth was centrifuged for removing the cells.  The supernatant 34 17  was  used  for  sulphate  concentration  analysis.  Sulphate  standard  curve  was 1 prepared  with  sodium  sulphate.  The  remaining  liquid  in  the  vial  was  used  for 2 optical density and cell counts analysis.  
3  4  5 3. Results and Discussion 6 Sulphate-reducing  bacteria (SRB)  comprise  of  a  very  diverse 7 phylogenetic  group  of  anaerobic  microbes  that  may  be  arranged  according  to 8 their  potential  metabolic  characteristics,  such  as  (i)  complete  mineralisation  of 9 organics, (ii) transformation of organics to acetate or similar low weight organics 10 and  (iii)  syntrophic  transformation of  organics  in  association  with,  for  example, 11 methanogens  (Plugge  et  al.,  2011).  SRB  metabolism  is  directly  affected  by 12 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  concentrations  which,  at  low  concentration  may 13 serve  them  as  carbon  source  (group  I  and  II),  or  at  high  concentrations  can 14 impose  them  a  toxic  response  (group  I,  II  and  III).  Therefore,  in  order  to 15 guarantee  success  in  EOR  procedures,  it  is  imperative  to  distinguish  the 16 concentration  threshold  that  can  contribute  to  sulphide  production  or  start  the 17 inhibiting control process of such production.  
18 In the case that surfactant and co-surfactant are used as carbon sources, 19 such  reaction  should  reflect  in  an  increase  of  sulphate  consumption  rate  as  it 20 generates  sulphide.  At  toxic  concentration,  however,  sulphate  removal  rates 21 should be lower or null compared to the controls because toxicity interfere with 22 such metabolic pathway. The generic stoichiometric reaction exemplifying such 23 a  sulphate-reducing  metabolism  is  shown  in  Equation  1.  In  this  formula, 24 organics are generalised as CHn. 
25  (CH)n + SO4 → 2CO2 + HS-   (Equation 1) 26 27  28 The goal of this research is to test surfactant and oil-pre-grown SRB to a 29 similar  medium  supplemented  with  distinct  concentrations  of  co-surfactant 30 (ethanol). The use of preadapted cells at the exponential growth phase is a fast 31 and reliable tool for assessing the effect of carbon sources changes or toxicity 32 in microbial metabolism (Chinalia and Killham, 2008).  
33 18  In  this  work,  sulphate-reducing  metabolic  activity  was  assessed  by 1 measuring sulphate removal rates (Equation 1) and the data compared against 2 several  combinations  of  carbon  sources  as  controls  (Fig.  1).  In  order  to  avoid 3 the delay of the microbial lag phase and decreases in sulphate removal rates, 4 cells were harvested for the testing at the end of the exponential growth phase 5 (12  h).  Thus,  the  effect  of  ethanol  supplementation  on  sulphate  removal  rates 6 could be readily assessed within a period of 4 hours.  
7 The highest sulphate consumption rate was observed at 1.5% ethanol in 8 the  presence  of  0.03%  and  1.4%  surfactant  and  oil,  respectively  (treatment  2, 9 Fig.  2  and  3).  Contrastingly,  however,  sulphate  consumption  rate  was  28  fold higher with the SRB consortium tests than with D. vulgaris (591 and 21 mg l-1 h-10 11 1, respectively). This result indicates a significant metabolic difference between 12 the  consortium  and the  model  sulphate-reducing  microbe  D.  vulgaris. 
13 Furthermore,  at  treatments  with  higher  ethanol  concentrations,  the  metabolic 14 activity  of  D.  vulgaris  was  null,  contrasting  with  the  considerable  sulphate 15 consumption  rates  observed  with  the  SRB  consortium.  Figure  4  shows  an 16 attempt to identifying the best ethanol concentration capable of increasing SRB 17 consortium  activity  in  such  a  condition.  The  results  show  that  ethanol 18 supplementation  up to  1.5%  can  significantly increase  SRB  sulphate 19 consumption  rates  (2.3  fold  compared  to  the  control  without  ethanol,  C4).  On 20 the  other  hand,  the  model  shown  in  Figure  4  suggests  that  inhibition  is  only 21 achieved  at  concentrations  higher  than  6.5%.  The  same  result  was  not 22 observed in the treatments with D. vulgaris (Fig. 3). The former bacteria showed 23 very little response to 0.5% ethanol supplementation and negative response to 24 concentrations higher than 1.5%. Figure 4, however, indicate that, in the case of 25 SRB consortium, any ethanol concentration between 0.1 to 6.5% can result in a 26 significant  increase  on  sulphate  consumption  when  compared  to  the  control 27 (mineral medium amended with surfactant and oil, C4). Thus, SRB consortium 28 is  a  more  reliable  tool  for  assessing  the  potential  effect  of  organics  during 29 sulphide production in mature oil wells environment than the model microbe, D. 
30 vulgaris.  
31  The  presence  of  surfactant  and  ethanol  in  T2  increased  3  fold  sulphate 32 removal rates of the SRB consortium when compared to the control, only when 33 oil was supplemented in the mineral media (C2, Fig. 2). Sulphate removal rates 34 19  of  the  SRB  consortium  on  surfactant,  as  sole  carbon  source  (C3,  Fig.  2),  was 1 1.6 fold higher than the observed in rich Postage medium. This result indicates 2 that  the  SRB  microbes  were  adapted  to  using  surfactant  or  even  ethanol  as 3 carbon  source.  Thus,  the  preadaptation  of  the  SRB  consortium  to  surfactant 4 and  oil  may  have  influenced  the  higher  sulphate  removal  ratios  on  surfactant 5 than  when  compared  with  rich  Postgate  media.  The  slope  of  the  consumption 6 rate curve shown in Figure 1, treatment C5, does not clearly indicate a potential 7 lag phase period. However, it is possible that the difference in the consumption 8 rates  between  SRB  consortium  in  the  C5  and  C3  controls,  may  be  related  to 9 metabolic re-adaptation to Postgate rich medium.  
10 Zhou et al (2015) showed that some SRB species could utilize ethanol as 11 carbon  source.  Figure  3  indicates  that,  in  spite  the  fact  that  D.  vulgaris  can process the surfactant (sulphate removal rate of 61 mg l-1 h-1 in C3); it respond 12 13 negatively  to  the  presence  of  high  concentrations  of  ethanol  (Fig.  3).  The 14 mixture of surfactant and oil (C4) induced a higher sulphate removal rate for D. 
15 vulgaris than the medium supplied with these substances separately. 
16  Specific growth rates values obtained with Figure 5 data corroborate with 17 the distinct sulphate removal rates assessed with mineral media supplemented 18 with  oil  only  (C2),  or  with  the  combination  of  surfactant,  oil  and  ethanol  (T2), 19 Figure  2.  The  growth  kinetics  of  the  SRB  consortium  shown  on  Figure  5 20 indicates  that  the  end  of  the  exponential  phase  is  around  12  h  and  that  OD 21 significantly correlates with the LN transformed values of colony  formation unit 22 (c.f.u.).  
23  The  data  shown  in  this  research  indicates  that  sulphate  removal  rates 24 were  not  only  influenced  by  modifications  in  the  biodisponibilisation  of  the  oil 25 caused by the addition of surfactant and co-surfactant (ethanol). Comparing the 26 sulphate removal rates obtained with C1 and C3 (Fig. 1, 2 and 3), it is clear that 27 SRB consortium and D. vulgaris were capable of using either the surfactant or 28 the ethanol as the sole carbon source for sustaining their metabolism. Lu et al (2013) demonstrated that surfactant at concentrations as high as 700 mg l-1 is 29 30 responsible  to  sustaining  or  even  increasing  microbial  biomass.  Contrastingly, 31 however,  Badawi  et  al  (2010)  observed  a  3  Log  reduction  on  Desulfomonas pigra biomass at surfactants concentration of 5 g l-1. Therefore, it is not only the 32 33 oil recovery efficiency allied with maximum low costs that should determine the 34 20  amount of surfactant and co-surfactant used for sustaining an EOR procedure. 
1 If the surfactant is used at significantly high concentrations this fact may confer 2 some  protection  against  oil  souring  based  on  such  compound  capability  of 3 inhibiting sulphate reducing bacteria. It would be not difficult to forecast savings 4 with the replacement of biocides during EOR procedure. Apart from often being 5 less  expensive  than  biocides,  higher  amounts  of  ethanol  can  also  significantly 6 assist  in  oil  recovery.  The  sector  spends  USD$  2  billion  with  biocides  in  their 7 attempt of avoiding such losses (Badawi et al., 2010). 
8  In  addition  to  SRB  inhibition,  Tawfik  and  Negm  (2016)  report  that 9 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  can  be  used  as  a  chemical  corrosion-inhibiting 10 agent for carbon steel. The fact is that adsorption of a surfactant enhances the 11 corrosion  resisting  property  of  the  metal.  This  effect  is  commonly  observed  at 12 surfactant  concentrations  above  the  critical  micellar  concentration  (CMC).  As 13 time elapses, however, biodegradation decreases surfactant concentration and 14 chemical  corrosion  may  then  take  place.  Nonetheless,  the  application  of 15 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  at  the  right  concentration  may  be  a  better 16 alternative for controlling sulphide biological production and chemical corrosion 17 than the alternatives such as biocides. In 1996, for instance, the cost associated 18 with microbial induced corrosion was estimated as between US$ 30 to 50 billion 19 for  the  oil  industry  (Vaidya  et  al.,  1996).  Therefore,  the  correct  application  of 20 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  may  significantly  contribute  to  reducing  such 21 expenses. Furthermore, the supplementation with co-surfactant as ethanol can 22 also not only increase oil recovery, but also assist in inhibiting SRB metabolism. 
23 Toxic surfactant oil concentration is often reported at concentrations above 2% 24 (Bera  and  Mandal,  2014).  Distinct  species  have  different  tolerance  to  toxic 25 compounds and, in the case of ethanol, this research has shown that the toxic 26 threshold for the SRB consortium is above 6.5% of ethanol (v/v).  
27  In  addition  to  SRB  inhibition,  ethanol  increases  oil/water  emulsion 28 coalescence  rates  creating  smaller  micellar  aggregates,  which  contributes  to 29 lower  probability  of  pore  plugging  improving  EOR  procedures  (Dahami  et  al., 
30 1988).  Ethanol  is  also  used  for  improving  surfactant  solubilisation  (2  fold)  in 31 water  (Taylor  et  al.,  2003).  Nonetheless,  it  should  be  highlighted  that  water 32 soluble alcohol improve oil solubility whilst less water soluble alcohols increase 33 interfacial tension between oil and water. Thus, less water soluble alcohols have 34 21  a  negative  effect  on  EOR  procedure  whilst  water  soluble  can  increase  oil 1 recovery  in  about  10%  (Dahami  et  al.,  1988).  High  interfacial  tension  between 2 oil and water phase causes the injected water to bypass the residual oil. On the 3 other hand, lower interfacial tension will not only improve oil flow, but it will also 4 favour  pore  wettability  in  the  rock  formation.  Thus,  surfactant  and  ethanol 5 mixture  can  be  a  good  alternative  for  improving  pore  wettability,  which  is 6 another  pivotal  variable  hindering  oil  recovery  from  mature  wells  (Jamaloei  et 7 al., 2011).  
8 In  conclusion,  this  research  shows  that  the  injection  of  liquid  containing 9 surfactant  and  co-surfactant  into  the  oil  formation  can  significantly  enhance 10 sulphide production if their concentrations are below the toxic threshold. On the 11 other hand, if a combination of surfactant and co-surfactants are injected in the 12 rock  formation  at  microbial  inhibiting  concentrations,  this  practice  shows  the 13 potential for increasing not only oil recovery, but it may also control souring.

The  Executive  Editor  first  evaluates  all  manuscripts  on technical aspects such as compliance to the Guide For Authors, quality of grammar or English language.  Revision  can  be  requested.  Manuscripts  accepted  at  this  stage  are  passed  to  the handling  editor  who  can  also  reject  on  the  basis  of  insufficient  originality,  serious  scientific flaws,  or  because  the  work  is  considered  outside  the  aims  and  scope  of  the  journal.  Those that  meet  the  minimum  criteria  are  passed  on  to  experts  for  review.  Referees  advise  the editor, who is responsible for the final decision to accept or reject the article.  Please note: Any  Editor's  decision  is  final.  Manuscripts  previously  rejected  by  the  Journal  will  not  be  re-considered by the Editors, and therefore will be rejected without review. 
 PREPARATION Manuscript Preparation General: Authors  must  follow  guide  for  authors  strictly,  failing  which  the  manuscripts  would  be rejected without review. Editors reserve the right to adjust the style to certain standards of uniformity. 
Structure: Follow  this  order  when  typing  manuscripts:  Title,  Authors,  Affiliations,  Abstract,  Keywords, Introduction,  Materials Conclusions, Acknowledgements,  References,  Figure  Captions,  Tables  and  Figures.  The  corresponding author  should  be  identified  with  an  asterisk  and  footnote.  All  other  footnotes  (except  for table  footnotes)  should  be  avoided.  Collate  acknowledgements  in  a  separate  section  at  the end  of  the  article  and  do  not  include  them  on  the  title  page,  as  a  footnote  to  the  title  or otherwise. 
Text Layout: Use double spacing and wide (3 cm) margins on white paper. (Avoid full justification, i.e., do not use a constant right-hand margin.) Ensure that each new paragraph is clearly indicated. 
Present  tables  and  figure  legends  on  separate  pages  at  the  end  of  the  manuscript.  If possible,  consult  a  recent  issue  of  the  journal  to  become  familiar  with  layout  and conventions. Number all pages consecutively, use 12 pt font size and standard fonts. 
Page  length:  Maximum  page  length  should  be  15,  35  and  40  pages  for  Short Communication,  Original  article/case  study  and  review  paper,  including  text,  references, tables and figures. Each figure and table must be put separately on a single page. 
Use of word processing software It  is  important  that  the  file  be  saved  in  the  native  format  of  the  word  processor  used.  The text  should  be  in  single-column  format.  Keep  the  layout  of  the  text  as  simple  as  possible. 
Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the Word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. 
The  electronic  text  should  be  prepared  in  a  way  very  similar  to  that  of  conventional manuscripts (see also the Guide to Publishing with Elsevier). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. 
See also the section on Electronic artwork. 
To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor. 
LaTeX You  are  recommended  to  use  the  Elsevier  article  class  elsarticle.cls  to  prepare  your manuscript  and  BibTeX  to  generate  your  bibliography.  Our  LaTeX  site  has  detailed submission instructions, templates and other information. 
 Article structure Subdivision - numbered sections Divide  your  article  into  clearly  defined  and  numbered  sections.  Subsections  should  be numbered  1.1  (then  1.1.1,  1.1.2,  ...),  1.2,  etc.  (the  abstract  is  not  included  in  section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. 
Introduction State  the  objectives  of  the  work  and  provide  an  adequate  background,  avoiding  a  detailed literature survey or a summary of the results. 
Results and  Methods, and  Discussion, 35  Material and methods Provide  sufficient  detail  to  allow  the  work  to  be  reproduced.  Methods  already  published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described. 
Theory/calculation A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis. 
Results and Discussion Results  should  be  clear  and  concise,  and  be  part  of  a  single  section,  discussing  the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. Extensive citation and discussion of the published literature should be avoided. 
Conclusions The main conclusions drawn from results should be presented in a short Conclusions section (maximum 100 words). 
Appendices If  there  is  more  than  one  appendix,  they  should  be  identified  as  A,  B,  etc.  Formulae  and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent  appendix,  Eq.  (B.1)  and  so  on.  Similarly  for  tables  and  figures:  Table  A.1;  Fig. 
A.1, etc. 
 Essential title page information • Title. Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible. 
•  Author  names  and  affiliations.  Please  clearly  indicate  the  given  name(s)  and  family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors' affiliation  addresses  (where  the  actual  work  was  done)  below  the  names.  Indicate  all affiliations  with  a  lowercase  superscript  letter  immediately  after  the  author's  name  and  in front of the appropriate address. 
Provide  the  full  postal  address  of  each  affiliation,  including  the  country  name  and,  if available, the e-mail address of each author. 
•  Corresponding  author.  Clearly  indicate  who  will  handle  correspondence  at  all  stages  of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author. 
•  Present/permanent  address.  If  an  author  has  moved  since  the  work  described  in  the article  was  done,  or  was  visiting  at  the  time,  a  'Present  address'  (or  'Permanent  address') may  be  indicated  as  a  footnote  to  that  author's  name.  The  address  at  which  the  author actually  did  the  work  must  be  retained  as  the  main,  affiliation  address.  Superscript  Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes. 
There  can  be  only  one  person  as  corresponding  author  and  manuscript  must  be submitted by the corresponding author in EES. 
 Abstract A concise and factual abstract is required. Each paper should be provided with an abstract of about  100-150  words.  The  abstract  should  state  briefly  the  purpose  of  the  research,  the principal  results  and  major  conclusions.  An  abstract  is  often  presented  separately  from  the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if  essential,  then  cite  the  author(s)  and  year(s).  Also,  non-standard  or  uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. 
Graphical abstract Although a graphical abstract is optional, its use is encouraged as it draws more attention to the  online  article.  The  graphical  abstract  should  summarize  the  contents  of  the  article  in  a concise,  pictorial  form  designed  to  capture  the  attention  of  a  wide  readership.  Graphical abstracts  should  be  submitted  as  a  separate  file  in  the  online  submission  system.  Image size:  Please  provide  an  image  with  a  minimum  of  531  ×  1328  pixels  (h  ×  w)  or proportionally  more.  The  image  should  be  readable  at  a  size  of  5  ×  13  cm  using  a  regular screen  resolution  of  96  dpi.  Preferred  file  types:  TIFF,  EPS,  PDF  or  MS  Office  files.  You  can view Example Graphical Abstracts on our information site. Authors can make use of Elsevier's Illustration and Enhancement service to ensure the Best presentation of their images and in accordance with all technical requirements: Illustration Service. 
Highlights Highlights  are  mandatory  for  this  journal.  They  consist  of  a  short  collection  of  bullet  points that  convey  the  core  findings  of  the  article  and  should  be  submitted  in  a  separate  editable file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 36  5  bullet  points  (maximum  85  characters,  including  spaces,  per  bullet  point).  You  can  view example Highlights on our information site. 
Keywords Immediately  after  the  abstract,  provide  a  maximum  of  5  keywords  to  be  included  in  an article, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid,  for  example,  "and",  "of").  Be  sparing  with  abbreviations:  only  abbreviations  firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes. 
Abbreviations Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first Page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at  their  first  mention  there,  as  well  as  in  the  footnote.  Ensure  consistency  of  abbreviations throughout the article. 
Acknowledgements Collate  acknowledgements  in  a  separate  section  at  the  end  of  the  article  before  the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.). 
Formatting of funding sources List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements: Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa]. 
It  is  not  necessary  to  include  detailed  descriptions  on  the  program  or  type  of  grants  and awards.  When  funding  is  from  a  block  grant  or  other  resources  available  to  a  university, college,  or  other  research  institution,  submit  the  name  of  the  institute  or  organization  that provided  the  funding.  If  no  funding  has  been  provided  for  the  research,  please  include  the following sentence: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. 
Units Follow  internationally  accepted  rules  and  conventions:  use  the international  system of  units (SI). If other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI. 
Math formulae Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line  with  normal  text  where  possible  and  use  the  solidus  (/)  instead  of  a  horizontal  line  for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number  consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text). 
Footnotes Footnotes  should  be  used  sparingly.  Number  them  consecutively  throughout  the  article. 
Many  Word  processors  can  build  footnotes  into  the  text,  and  this  feature  may  be  used. 
Otherwise,  please  indicate  the  position  of  footnotes  in  the  text  and  list  the  footnotes themselves  separately  at  the  end  of  the  article.  Do  not  include  footnotes  in  the  Reference list. 
 Artwork Electronic artwork General points • Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork. 
• Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option. 
•  Aim  to  use  the  following  fonts  in  your  illustrations:  Arial,  Courier,  Times  New  Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar. 
• Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text. 
• Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files. 
• Provide captions to illustrations separately. 
• Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version. 
• Submit each illustration as a separate file. 
A detailed guide on electronic artwork is available. 
You  are  urged  to  visit  this  site;  some  excerpts  from  the  detailed  information  are given here. 
Formats  If  your  electronic  artwork  is  created  in  a  Microsoft  Office  application  (Word,  PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format. 
Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the 37  resolution  requirements  for  line  drawings,  halftones,  and  line/halftone  combinations  given below): EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts. 
TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi. 
TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black & white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi. 
TIFF  (or  JPEG):  Combinations  bitmapped  line/half-tone  (color  or  grayscale),  keep  to  a minimum of 500 dpi. 
Please do not: • Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors; • Supply files that are too low in resolution; • Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content. 
Color artwork Please  make  sure  that  artwork  files  are  in  an  acceptable  format  (TIFF  (or  JPEG),  EPS  (or PDF),  or  MS  Office  files)  and  with  the  correct  resolution.  If,  together  with  your  accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these  figures  will  appear  in  color  online  (e.g.,  ScienceDirect  and  other  sites)  regardless  of whether  or  not  these  illustrations  are  reproduced  in  color  in  the  printed  version.  For  color reproduction in print, you will receive information regarding the costs from Elsevier after receipt of your accepted article.  Please  indicate  your  preference  for  color: in  print or online only. Further information on the preparation of electronic artwork. 
Figure captions Ensure  that  each  illustration  has  a  caption.  Supply  captions  separately,  not  attached  to  the figure.  A  caption  should  comprise  a  brief title  (not on  the  figure  itself)  and  a  description  of the  illustration.  Keep  text  in  the  illustrations  themselves  to  a  minimum  but  explain  all symbols  and  abbreviations  used.  Note  that  the  maximum  number  of  figures  allowed  for Original article, case study, and review papers is 6. Multiple figures can be expressed as one figure  (for  e.g.  1a,  1b,  1c  etc...),  while  retaining  the  maximum  limit  of  6.The  Journal discourages  publication  of  simple  one  line  graphs/figures,  pattern  figures,  conventional spectra (X-ray, FTIR, UV, NMR, etc) and SEM photographs of a routine nature. 
Tables Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text. Place footnotes to  tables  below  the  table  body  and  indicate  them  with  superscript  lowercase  letters.  Avoid vertical rules. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in tables do not  duplicate  results  described  elsewhere  in  the  article.  Note  that  the  maximum  number  of figures allowed for Original  article,  case  study,  and  review  papers  is  6.  The  Journal  discourages  publication  of simple  one  parameter  tables;  such  information  should  be  preferably  described  in  the  text itself. 
References Maximum 25, 50 and 100 references for short communication, original research paper/case study and review papers, respectively. 
Citation in text Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice  versa).  Any  references  cited  in  the  abstract  must  be  given  in  full.  Unpublished  results and  personal  communications  are  not  recommended  in  the  reference  list,  but  may  be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the  standard  reference  style  of  the  journal  and  should  include  a  substitution  of  the publication  date  with  either  'Unpublished  results'  or  'Personal  communication'.  Citation  of  a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication. 
Web references As  a  minimum,  the  full  URL  should  be  given  and  the  date  when  the  reference  was  last accessed.  Any  further  information,  if  known  (DOI,  author  names,  dates,  reference  to  a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., 
after  the  reference  list)  under  a  different  heading  if  desired,  or  can  be  included  in  the reference list. 
References in a special issue Please  ensure  that  the  words  'this  issue'  are  added  to  any  references  in  the  list  (and  any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue. 
Reference management software Most  Elsevier  journals  have  their  reference  template  available  in  many  of  the  most  popular reference  management  software  products.  These  include  all  products  that  support  Citation Style  Language  styles,  such  as  Mendeley  and  Zotero,  as  well  as  EndNote.  Using  the  word 38  processor plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template  when  preparing  their  article,  after  which  citations  and  bibliographies  will  be automatically formatted in the journal's style. If no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this Guide. Users of  Mendeley  Desktop  can  easily  install  the  reference  style  for  this  journal  by  clicking  the following  link:  http://open.mendeley.com/use-citation-style/bioresource-technology.  When preparing  your  manuscript,  you  will  then  be  able  to  select  this  style  using  the  Mendeley plugins for Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. 
Reference style Text: All citations in the text should refer to: 1. Single author: the author's name (without initials, unless there is ambiguity) and the year of publication; 2. Two authors: both authors' names and the year of publication; 3. Three or more authors: first author's name followed by 'et al.' and the year of publication. 
Citations  may  be  made  directly  (or  parenthetically).  Examples:  'as  demonstrated  (Allan, 2000a, 2000b, 1999; Allan and Jones, 1999). Kramer et al. (2010) have recently shown ....' 
List:  References  should  be  arranged  first  alphabetically,  THEN  NUMBERED  NUMERICALLY, and then further sorted chronologically if necessary. More than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., placed after the year of publication.

 AFTER ACCEPTANCE Publication of Articles After  acceptance  the  Journal  will  publish  articles  quickly  both  online  and  in  print.  Requests for delayed publication of the accepted articles are generally not acceptable. 
Online proof correction Corresponding  authors  will  receive  an  e-mail  with  a  link  to  our  online  proofing  system, allowing annotation and correction of proofs online. The environment is similar to MS Word: in  addition  to  editing  text,  you  can  also  comment  on  figures/tables  and  answer  questions from the Copy Editor. 
Web-based  proofing  provides  a  faster  and  less  error-prone  process  by  allowing  you  to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors. 
40  If  preferred,  you  can  still choose  to  annotate  and  upload  your  edits  on  the  PDF  version.  All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF. 
We  will  do  everything  possible  to  get  your  article  published  quickly  and  accurately.  Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication. Please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.
